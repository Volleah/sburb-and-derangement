# I: Introduction

Let’s just cut right to the chase. This doc will ideally help explain how to make a character using the RPGStuck 3rd edition character sheet. If you already know how to make a character, or if you are comfortable with Google Sheets, or if you messed around and figured it out just fine, you probably won’t need this doc. But if you’re having trouble with the sheet, broke the code on it accidentally, or just want a more concrete walkthrough with images, this might help. Folks ask a lot of questions about this sheet, and while I think it’s a really good sheet, it isn’t super intuitive to get started with. This aims to change that.

## What You’ll Need

To start with, you will need to open the following documents, and fully read the following sections of certain documents:

- [[RPGStuck/Miscellaneous/Homepage\|Homepage]]. This contains everything you’re likely to need, including the documents listed below.
- [[RPGStuck/Primer/RPGStuck Rule Primer\|RPGStuck Rule Primer]]. This is your guide to making a character, so you’ll need it open often. I recommend reading the entire document if you can, but you will absolutely need to read the Core Rules and Character Creation sections all the way through. No way around it, if you haven’t done this part then read those before continuing with this guide.
- [The 3e Character Sheet](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12mu9k2Q8u4taLdC5GZJy6-p82IFQaqqUZrU_CTAhFPs/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730625606443018&usg=AOvVaw0Op-ykLjPLDQJp11SKKSzC). This is, of course, the character sheet itself. You’ll find you can’t edit it right now, that’s fine, I’ll explain later how to use this. For now, try and get familiar with it and how it has different things on different tabs.

It is also recommended (but not required) that you read all the documents in this system before making a character, however, the most important ones for you as a player would be the other sections of the [[RPGStuck/Primer/RPGStuck Rule Primer\|RPGStuck Rule Primer]], the [[RPGStuck/Strife Specibus/Strife Specibi\|Strife Specibi]], the [[RPGStuck/Psionic Powers/Psionic Powers\|Psionic Powers]]
, the [[RPGStuck/Decors and Demeanors/Decors and Demeanors\|Decors and Demeanors]], and the [[RPGStuck/Pillars and Paths/Pillars and Paths\|Pillars and Paths]]. Extra bonus points if you read through all of them and try to process what they’re all about, however, you can do this as you go.

I also highly recommend making a character on your computer instead of a smartphone or tablet. Google Sheets is functional on those devices, but it’s much harder to use comfortably. The images and instructions in this guide will assume you’re on a computer. I run a Windows machine, so some keyboard commands may differ if you use Mac. I’ll try and include both if I know them, but no promises.

You ready? Then let’s go.

# II: Getting Familiar

## Setting Up Your Sheet

Go ahead and open up the [3e Character Sheet](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12mu9k2Q8u4taLdC5GZJy6-p82IFQaqqUZrU_CTAhFPs/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730625606444943&usg=AOvVaw022vf38_6j8m10Xj8muxDH) now if you haven’t already. You should see something that looks like this:

![](/img/user/Attachments/image32.png)

Lots to look at here, of course. But if you try editing any of the cells, you’ll find you can’t. What gives? Well, this is the publicly accessible character sheet that everyone makes copies from, so you aren’t able to start making your character until you make a copy of it for yourself!

![](/img/user/Attachments/image54.png)

In order to do that, look up at the upper left corner of this screen and click on the button that says File.

Then, move down and click the text that says “Make a Copy”. ![](/img/user/Attachments/image50.jpg)

![](/img/user/Attachments/image11.png)

This will open a window in the middle of your screen that says “Copy document” right at the top. Feel free to type in whatever name you want for your character and save it to your Drive. Once you’ve finished, press OK.

Your copy of the sheet should open automatically in a new tab, with the name you gave the sheet and the ability to edit it. As you may be able to see, it no longer says “View only” in the upper left corner. For the purposes of this document, I’ll be using one of my characters named Suzy Quince.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image49.png)

## What’s On This Sheet?

Everything, just about! I definitely recommend looking through each of the individual tabs on the document to see what you can find on your own, but don’t edit anything yet. However, I’ll go through most of it here.

### The Different Tabs

![](/img/user/Attachments/image47.png)

At the bottom of your character sheet you should be able to see several different tabs, each of which going to a different page that serves a different purpose. You should be on the Character tab to start with, so let’s talk about that!

#### Character

The Character tab will be the main tab you use when playing a game, and it’s where you’ll track your current HP, status effects, resources, etc. We won’t go into all the details here outside of what you do for character creation.

>[!success] on the Character tab, you will be editing:
> 
> - What weapons you’re holding and armor you have equipped (not the details of those items though)
> - Your crit range, hit bonuses, and defense bonuses if you have them
> - Any consumable resources you might have (psionic slots, racial abilities, demeanors)
> - What weapons and/or psionic powers you are proficient with, and the damage rolls for these tools
> - The stat you use to attack with each weapon or psionic power you have
> - Your pillar, and your milestones from that pillar
> - Your decors and demeanors
> - Your sylladex

> [!important] In addition, as you play your character, your Character tab can be used to include:
> 
> - Your XP, level, and current Hit Points
> - Your level 5 and beyond specializations (not your level 1 specialization though)
> - Your path features
> - Your grist and boondollars
> - Anything you have inside your sylladex
> - Any buffs or debuffs you might have

> [!fail] On the Character tab, you will not be editing:
> 
> - Your base speed and initiative checks
> - Your Psionic Casting Modifier
> - Your ability scores
> - Your skill points
> - Your maximum Hit Points and the size of your Hit Die
> - Your racial features
> - Your base resistances
> - Your level 1 specialization

If you change any of those on the Character tab instead of the Mechanics tab, you’ve just broken your sheet. Undo what you just did or in extreme cases, get a new sheet and start over.

#### Biography

![](/img/user/Attachments/image52.png)

The Biography tab is where you put most of the non-mechanical features about a character. Their backstory, their personality, any hobbies they have, all that will go here. We won’t be spending a lot of time talking about this tab, it’s pretty self-explanatory.

#### Mechanics

![](/img/user/Attachments/image14.png)

The Mechanics tab will be one of the main tabs you use when making your character. Definitely take the time to know this page as well as possible, you’ll be seeing it a lot during character creation.

>[!success] On the Mechanics tab, you will be editing:
> 
> - The names of your rungs on your echeladder
> - Your ability scores and racial bonuses
> - Your maximum Hit Points and the size of your Hit Dice
> - Your racial features
> - Your skill points
> - Whether you’re a martial, hybrid, or psion
> - The stats you use for your Armor Class
> - Your Psionic Casting Modifier
> - Your level 1 specialization

>[!faq] In addition, as you play your character, your Mechanics tab can be used to include:
> 
> - Your stat increases
> - Your Stages every other Decor
> - More skill points
> - Increases to your maximum Hit Points
#### Strife Deck

![](/img/user/Attachments/image41.png)

The Strife Deck tab is where you put all your weapons. We’ll come back to how to use this later, but it’s basically just a list of weapons that you have. Nice.

#### Wearables

![](/img/user/Attachments/image19.png)

Your Wearables tab is pretty similar to the Strife Deck tab, except instead of listing weapons, it lists armor and accessories. Again, we’ll come back to how to use this later.

#### Atheneum

![](/img/user/Attachments/image48.png)

Your Atheneum tab is pretty similar to the previous two tabs, except instead of listing weapons or armor, it lists what alchemy you’ve done. We won’t touching on this tab again during this document, as it is only used during gameplay.

#### Household

![](/img/user/Attachments/image53.png)

Your Household tab tracks what gate you’ve reached, what housebuilding unlocks you’ve gotten, and the boondollars you get as you level up. Again, we won’t touching on this tab again during this document, as it is only used during gameplay. That being said if you wanna write out what your character’s house looks like in advance on the Household Blackboard to the right, that’s something you can do. I usually only remember to do that after I already get into a session.

#### Customization

![](/img/user/Attachments/image30.png)

Your Customization tab allows you to put your own homebrew specibi, psionic powers, and path features into the sheet itself. It’s really cool that this is offered, but making homebrew is outside the scope of this document, and we won’t be detailing how to use it and balance it here.

# III: Building A Character

Remember when I said you need to read those sections in the Rule Primer, and to have the Primer open? This is why. The Character Creation section (starting at the bottom of Page 5) lays out a very clear roadmap to making a character from start to finish, and one I recommend following until you’re comfortable making characters without it. Hell, I still follow the roadmap whenever I make characters, even after making loads of them.

The Overview in the Primer’s Character Creation section goes over roughly the same stuff I just mentioned in What’s On This Sheet?, in case you need a refresher. And from there…

## Identity

I think this section is self-explanatory, it’s just choosing the core concept of your character. We won’t be going over the process of making good characters here, as this guide is more focused on the mechanical technique of filling out your sheet properly. However, I generally use this step as a sign to choose a name, figure out their gender, start thinking about their racials, and add their chumhandle if the concept is strong enough. Then I add these things to the top of the Character tab.

For Suzy, our example character, I’ve filled out her name, gender, species, chumhandle, and my own handle. I also know I want her to be a healing-focused character, with a passion for soap operas and who might not start drama in her friend group but sure will enjoy watching it. I won’t put her interests in her sheet yet, but I’ll keep that in the back of my mind for later.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image3_1.png)

## Race

Alright, let’s get to the mechanical stuff. You’ll want to choose your racials right here, if you’re a human or if you’re a troll, and in both cases which racial features you want to have. To put them in your sheet, go to your Mechanics tab (the tabs are at the bottom of your character sheet). You’ll be making three different changes here. Firstly, find the dropdown right next to the box saying Caste, it should be just underneath the Hit Die and the ability scores. You’ll choose there whether you’re a highblood, midblood, lowblood, or human.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image8_1.png)

![](/img/user/Attachments/image6_1.png)

If you aren’t sure which caste you should fill in, check the Rule Primer on Page 7-8, there’s a table of all the different racials there, and one of the columns says “Caste” right at the top. Use that!

Secondly, look directly below the Caste box, and you’ll find a dropdown next to the sentence “What’s your race?” You’ll choose exactly which racials you have, whether you’re a burgundy, a teal, a fuschia, or even a human (shocking, really). The box underneath that should automatically update with the racial features you get for that race, such as stat bonuses, psionic gradient, and racial abilities. Don’t worry about adding those in just yet, we’ll get there.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image27.png)

Finally, look directly below the “What’s your race” section, and you’ll find a dropdown next to the sentence “And your racial ability?”. Choose which racial ability you want out of the options you have available to your character. If you’re not sure what any of them do, check pages 8-10 of the Rule Primer.

You might have noticed in the Rule Primer that each race can choose between 2-4 different abilities. Some castes have fewer options (like tealbloods, who can only choose between On Patrol or the Midblood racial ability), some castes can choose more than one unique option (like burgundybloods, who can choose the Left Hand Rule or Psi Pulse options which are listed under Psionic Gift, or the Lowblood racial ability), and humans can choose any of the four different options from the Childhood racial feature.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image16.png)

For Suzy, we’ve already established that she’s a human. I list her Caste as Human, her race as Human, and I choose the Well-Educated option from Childhood (I think that will work best for her character and her mechanics, probably).

![](/img/user/Attachments/image20.png)

Finally, you apply those racial features to your sheet. Your Psionic Gradient is already being calculated (don’t worry about changing anything like that!), so it’s just about adding your stat bonuses, and making sure to remember your racial ability.

For Suzy, this isn’t a problem and we’ll talk about both of those things as we go. However, if you have a limited use ability (such as Bronzeblood’s Brave, or Ceruleanblood’s Killing Flair), I would recommend adding it as a Resource on your Character tab. Again, we will talk about this later, but for now just notice that the racial feature you chose has been added to your Character tab automatically right underneath your weapons on the left side of the page.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image46.png)

## Stats

Now you’ll want to choose your stats. Go back to the Mechanics tab and scroll to the top middle of the page to find the section of your sheet dealing with ability scores. Do not change your ability scores or modifiers on the Character tab. This is one of the most common mistakes people make, and it breaks the sheet.![](/img/user/Attachments/image26.png)

As you can see, there are three columns in white here, and those are the only ones you’ll need to edit. Assign the standard array as listed in the Primer as you see fit, one number per stat, in the Initial column. After that, move over to the Racial column on the right and add your racial stat bonuses. You can safely ignore the Bonus column for the time being.

Shown below is Suzy’s stat array. I gave her high Wisdom for her medical skill and Insight, good Dexterity for the weapons I want her to use, and decent Charisma for her bedside manner. Note that the Initial column doesn’t have the racial stat bonuses applied, but the Total column automatically adds up the racial bonuses I added in the Racial column.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image44.png)

## Psionics

Ah, psionics. This is a more complex part of the system in some ways, so let’s get started with the basics. As it says in the Primer (pages 12-13), you’ll choose whether you are a martial, hybrid, or psion character. Once you’ve decided which your character is, find the dropdown on your Mechanics tab labeled with “Psionics?” on the middle right side of the page, across from Skill Points on the left.![](/img/user/Attachments/image10.png)

After this, you’ll want to choose your Psionic Casting Modifier. This could be important even if you’re playing a martial character, but it’s crucial for psions and hybrids. Check the Mechanics tab right under your Skill Points, and change the stat in question to Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, (or even Strength, but that’s pretty rare). Then read on to see your next steps.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image25.png)

If you’re playing a Martial character, you can safely ignore most of this section. You don’t know any psionic powers or subpowers at this point (unless you choose a racial ability that gives you one). You will gain all abilitechs for your strife specibi (which we will explain later), and your Hit Dice increase by one size (from a d6 to a d8). You can find the dropdown to change your Hit Die on the Mechanics tab right above your Caste. I recommend newer players start off with a martial character, it’s just easier to make. Suzy, our example character, is martial, so you can see the only things that I did below.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image57.png)![](/img/user/Attachments/image58.png)

If you’re playing a hybrid character, there are different steps you’ll take. After you change your “Psionics?” box to say hybrid, you would not increase your Hit Dice from a d6 to a d8. However, you will add a psionic power to your sheet. Move over to your Character tab, and find the large section for weapons and psionic powers, directly below your Resources.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image38.png)

That’s a complex set of boxes huh? Let’s break this down.

### Listing Weapons and Powers

![](/img/user/Attachments/image21.jpg)

- Section 1 is where you put the name of your weapon or psionic power. In the example given here, the weapon used is a gladius, even though we don’t have gladiuskind in the system. This is entirely a flavor decision and does not affect the mechanics of the weapon or psionic power. Hell, you can call a pickaxekind weapon Cakekind, or the Enchant psionic power Speedrun Glitches. That’s fine, that’s entirely for the flavor of your character and how you want them to fight. I can’t hammer home this point enough so let me say it once again, the mechanics your weapon uses can be different to what you call the weapon. This is a practice called reflavoring or reskinning by the community, and I highly recommend giving it a go if the weapons on offer don’t suit your fancy.
- Section 2 is where you choose which mechanics you’re using for your weapon or psionic power. Sure, you can reflavor Macekind as a Baseball Bat, but you’d still put Macekind in section 2 because those are the mechanics you’re using.
- Section 3 is where you put the tier of your weapon or psionic focus. Don’t worry about this during character creation, but when you alchemize some new gear, you’ll need to change this on your sheet to get the benefits.
- Section 4 is the stat modifier you’re using to make attack rolls with this weapon. This one you need to change manually. If you’re using a Brutality weapon make sure to change it to STR, Finesse weapons you can use either STR or DEX for, and psionic powers will use your Psionic Casting Modifier, as explained below. Whatever it is, make sure to update this part of your sheet accordingly.
- Section 5 are the damage values for each attack. The RPGStuck sheet does not automatically calculate the damage of the attacks you have, given that various different abilities or bits of alchemy can change that damage directly. So you’ll have to put it in yourself. So if your basic attack did Qd10+STR instead, you would type that into the boxes in that column, or if your psionic attack did Qd4+PCM, you would put that in as well. You do have to do this manually, but it should say the base damage of each attack or move in the Description section on the right side.

I will give an example of this for Suzy when we get down to the specibi, but it works identically for your psionic powers. Choose one psionic power from the [[RPGStuck/Psionic Powers/List of Psionic Powers\|List of Psionic Powers]], and you gain one subpower from that power at level one. (A psionic power being something like [[RPGStuck/Psionic Powers/List of Psionic Powers#Electrokinesis\|Electrokinesis]], the overarching thing, while a subpower is like Lightning Bolt, a collection of moves under the same name). You also only have one non-basic abilitech for your weapon(s) of choice at level one, but you’ll gain those back as you level up.

If you’re playing a full psion, it’s quite similar to playing a hybrid so I won’t retread old ground. You will gain two psionic powers instead of one, knowing all the subpowers from one of these and knowing only one subpower from the other. Your Fortitude and Reflex saves will automatically be reduced by two (you don’t have to change anything!), but you won’t learn any non-basic abilitechs for your weapons and the damage dice for your weapons are reduced by one size (Qd8 down to Qd6, for example). Again, you will have to reduce the damage dice for your weapons on your sheet manually.

In both cases, don’t delete the subpowers you don’t yet know, just find your way of marking that you don’t yet have access to them. I like turning the text grey personally, some people make the subpowers they haven’t earned yet have strikethrough text, and some folks just mark it on the sheet somewhere that it won’t break any code. Whatever you do, make sure you know what abilitechs and subpowers you have, and which ones you have yet to learn.

## Strife Specibi and Armor

You may be wondering why I skipped the Pillar section in the Rule Primer. It’s because you can choose your specibi and your pillar in either order, and personally, I find that it’s helpful to choose your weapons and armor before figuring out what build you want them to have. Whichever one works for you though!

You automatically have proficiency in one strife specibus, so check the [[RPGStuck/Strife Specibus/Strife Specibus List\|Strife Specibus List]] and choose the weapon you want your character to use. Then add it to the Character tab on your sheet as I explained above in the Listing Weapons and Powers section of this document.

If you have more than two different weapons or psionic powers, or if your psionic power seems to be missing some features, check the left side of the screen. You should see a double-sided arrow in between the cells, and clicking that expands the hidden rows within a weapon block, as demonstrated below with Cryokinesis.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image33.jpg)

The same applies if you need more weapon slots (say, if you have two weapons and a psionic power or two). This set of arrows is slightly lower, just underneath the two normal weapon grids. Clicking it allows up to six weapon/power slots.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image34.jpg)

![](/img/user/Attachments/image40.png)

In addition, if you wish to re-hide some rows you don’t need, just highlight the numbers of the rows that you don’t need on the left side of the screen…

Then right click the highlighted numbers and select “Hide rows”.![](/img/user/Attachments/image18.jpg)

I decided that I want Suzy to use a machine pistol, with the mechanics of Pistolkind, as her primary weapon, so I’ve added it to her sheet. Notice that while the weapon I use has a different name it still has the mechanics of Pistolkind, that I changed the Stat she uses to hit into DEX (Pistolkind uses DEX), and that I’ve changed the damage values manually based on what the Description column says.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image23.png)

After this, go back to the Mechanics tab and find the box that says “What stats does your wardrobe use?”, in the same box as your resistance proficiencies and stat increases, between your skill points and the “Psionics?” box.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image2_1.png)

This is where you can choose which two stats are used to calculate your Armor Class, so this is an important decision. The only restriction is that you cannot choose Constitution as one of these stats unless you have the Sentinel pillar (if that sounds interesting, then make this choice after you read the Pillar section below).![](/img/user/Attachments/image39.png)

For Suzy, I know she’ll be using her Dexterity and Wisdom often for shooting and medicine respectively, so I made those two the stats for her AC.

## Pillar

At first level, you won’t be getting any path features or choosing a Keystone, but you do get to choose your Pillar. Check the Pillars and Paths document and choose whichever Pillar you want to choose. Designing a build for your character is outside the scope of this document.

Once you’ve decided on a pillar, go to the Character tab on your character sheet, and look for the Pillar and Steps section of your document, directly below your weapons and/or psionic powers, and between the Pillar, Racial, and Milestones section and the Decors and Demeanor section.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image17.png)

As you can see, the first box in the Pillar and Steps section says “You should pick a pillar!” Use this dropdown to choose your pillar. Once you’ve done so, move over to the Pillar, Racial, and Milestones section to the left. There should be a box that says “You should pick a lvl 1 milestone!” Use that dropdown to select the level 1 milestone from your pillar, or choose which level 1 milestone you want if you’re playing a Slayer. Our example character Suzy is playing a Strategist (due to her wanting various path features from Strategist paths), so I’ve made the necessary changes below.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image37.png)

As I said earlier, you won’t need to worry about any path features until after level 1, so that’s it for this section.

## Skills and Proficiencies

Your character starts off having Proficiency in one of your resistances (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). Head back to the Mechanics tab and look just above where your AC stats are calculated, right next to the Stat Increases section.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image13.png)

Then just click one of the boxes besides the resistance you want to increase. Your sheet automatically adds your proficiency bonus, so you never need to worry about that again!![](/img/user/Attachments/image4_1.png)

For Suzy, she’s going to be proficient in Fortitude, as she dumped Strength and her Constitution is middling at best. You can also choose your proficiencies to help boost your best resistance even further, but I prefer to cover my weaknesses.

Next, navigate over to the list of Skills, just to the left of here on the Mechanics tab.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image42.png)

It looks a little intimidating but really, it’s quite straightforward! Your sheet will automatically calculate almost everything for you, it adds your stat bonuses, it adds Expertise (something you can get as you level up, don’t worry about it now), and it adds your skill points once you spend them. As a level one character, you start off with six skill points. If you want to invest skill points in a given skill, just put the number of skill points you spent in the box to the right of the skill name. You can only spend up to the number in the Max column to the right of this section, and you can check the bottom of the Skill Points section to see how many points you’ve spent.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image51.png)

For Suzy, she starts with 12 skill points due to her racial feature! Quite the skill monkey character she is. Notice that even if I wanted to put more points in Medicine, I can’t due to it being capped at 3 by the Max column, and that the Total Skill Points box says 12 because that’s the maximum amount of skill points she has available. Keep in mind you can’t save skill points for later, so spend them wisely!

## Decors, Demeanors, and Specialization

We’re almost done with the big mechanical stuff I swear, this nightmare of a doc is nearing its conclusion. Go back to the Character tab and find the section labeled Decors and Demeanor, to the right of the Pillar and Steps section.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image56.png)

Open up the [[RPGStuck/Decors and Demeanors/Decors and Demeanors\|Decors and Demeanors]] doc and choose your Demeanor and your first Decor, putting them in the top two dropdowns on your sheet. For Suzy, I chose the Artifice demeanor (and that tells you a lot about her personality, doesn’t it?), alongside the Expertise: First Aid decor. She is, after all, a medical student.![](/img/user/Attachments/image1 1.png)

Finally, go back to your Mechanics tab and scroll all the way to the bottom to find the section labeled “Anything...special about you?”

![](/img/user/Attachments/image36.png)

This is where you choose your level one specialization. RPGStuck recommends that you stick with All-Rounder when starting to learn how to make characters, and Suzy will do the same, gaining 4 more skill points for even more skill monkeyness.

## Cleanup

There’s just a few final things you’ll need to do before your character is mechanically done. Firstly, scroll up to the upper right corner of your Mechanics tab.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image29.png)

Roll your Hit Die (listed right below your ability scores to the left) and put that result next to the number 1 in the Level column. You’ll be doing this every time you gain a new level. Next, move over to the upper left corner, and in the box where it says “[what’s my rung?]”, type in whatever name you want for your first level. You don’t need to type in all the other levels when first making a character, and it can be better if your rung names reflect the session they’re in, but the choice is yours. Looks like Suzy got a pretty average roll for her Hit Points, and chose her first rung name.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image7_1.png)

Next you’ll want to create and populate a fetch modus (or an inventory to avoid the Homestuck terms). Go to your Character tab and scroll all the way to the bottom, to the right of your Grist and Boondollars.

![](/img/user/Attachments/image24.png)

> Start by clicking the dropdown menu next to the text “What kind of captchalogue deck do you have?” There are four different types of modii:
> 
> - The Default modus. You can captchalogue items of your size or smaller, and they deal 1d4 damage when ejected.
> - The Heavy modus. You can captchalogue items up to one size larger than you (so yes, grab a full-sized bed or a modest car), and they deal 1d6 damage, but their range goes down to 15 ft.
> - The Light modus. You can only take items one size smaller than you or smaller, but the range increases to 60 ft.
> - The Packrat modus. Your items only deal 1 damage, however, your inventory increases to 70 slots. The way you find these slots is by clicking the double arrows on the bottom left side of the screen (see below).

![](/img/user/Attachments/image28.jpg)

After you’ve chosen what kind of captchalogue deck you have, you can choose a name for your modus by typing in whatever you like where it says “[insert name here]”. In addition, to the right of that box there is a dropdown menu. Choose which skill you want to use to make attacks with your sylladex. It can be any skill, so don’t hesitate to choose your best one. For example, Suzy has chosen the Operation Modus, using Medicine to attack. Notice that the name of the Modus in the top of the section has automatically changed as well.

Once you’ve decided on your modus, keep in mind that you will mostly likely not have to worry about sylladex shenanigans after entry, similar to how it was during Homestuck. Most of the sylladex jank got ignored after Act 2 or so, and it’s usually about the same in RPGStuck sessions. That being said, one very common thing that prospective SMs look for is a filled-out sylladex, so take the time to figure out what your character might have in their pockets or backpack. Do they carry a little whittling knife, a walking stick, a minifridge, a life-sized portrait of themselves? As long as it’s not too over-the-top, it’s a fairly easy way to appeal to your prospective SMs.

Next you’ll want to make sure you have your weapons and armor set up. For your weapons, go to your Strife Deck tab (yes, it’s not Mechanics or Character this time, we’ve just about finished with both of them for character creation!). Name your weapon, say what specibus it belongs to, and give it some flavor text! This is a Tier 0 weapon with no effects (unless you take a certain Specialization that may or may not be getting scrapped/reworked). For example, here’s Suzy’s machine pistol.

Next, you’ll want to do about the same thing in the Wearables tab, except now you’re designing your armor. This can of course be basically anything you wear, from a hoodie to glasses to fancy shoes to full plate. You can also give yourself accessories in this tab, which are useful for psionic foci or just to give your character some personality. I’ve included Suzy’s main armor along with a couple of accessories, to get your ideas flowing.

Once you’ve given yourself your weapons, foci, armor, and accessories, it’s time to equip them! Navigate back over to the Character tab and check out the upper right corner for the section called Wardrobifier, to the right of your Status Debuffs.

There are two separate hand slots, in case you’re holding two different weapons one in each hand. Put your weapon(s) in the dropdown menus there. Your main armor should be put in the Wardrobe dropdown menu, and any accessories you have should go in one of the three Accessory dropdown menus. Here you can see Suzy fully equipped with her gear. Keep in mind that accessories do not show their flavor text, the boxes are too small for that, so put any extra banter in the Effects box.![](/img/user/Attachments/image45.png)![](/img/user/Attachments/image12.png)

And of course, now that you’ve finished all the mechanical parts of your character, go back to the Biography page and fill out everything in there. Again, this document is not going to go into how to make characters as good as possible, given its mechanical focus, but that is equally as important as everything we’ve talked about so far, or even more important.

### How To Use Resources

You might also have a few different features (racial features, demeanor, ammo, psionic slots) that are limited-use abilities, recharging after a certain amount of time, by means of a certain action, or after a rest. For these, we’ll use the Resources blocks on the Character tab of your sheet, just underneath your armor class and resistances.

You can use these for any sort of limited-use or recharging ability, but for this example I’ll be using it to keep track of Suzy’s demeanor, which can be used P times per long rest, and Suzi’s ammo for her weapon.

To set up a Resources block, start by replacing the Name with whatever name you want to give your resource.

After this, input the maximum amount of that resource you’re going to have next to the word Maximum. As you can see, it looks a little unfinished.

And finally, put the same number next to the word Current, assuming you start with the maximum amount of your resource. Some resources will actually start at zero (Thaumaturge’s Dreams come to mind), but for the two we’re using here and most resources you’ll worry about at level one, both of them start at full.

Whenever you use up your resources (using your ammo, using your demeanor, spending slots, etc.), you reduce the number in the Current box by whatever amount is appropriate, and when you regain those resources you would increase that number again.

# IV: Closing Remarks

So there you go, a complete guide to using the RPGStuck 3e Character Sheet. Let me know if there’s anything I should add or clarify in this doc, it’s here to help make life easier for new players, and if it doesn’t do that then it needs to. I’m calculatedTheatrics#5161 on the Discord, this has been the work of several hours of manic writing and screenshotting, never ask me for anything ever again. owo
