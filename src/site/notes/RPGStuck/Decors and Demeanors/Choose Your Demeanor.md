>[!quote] “Okay but who are you?”

Every person has some activities that they excel in, whether it’s going for a run, keeping time with a metronome, or talking their way out of a murder investigation. In RPGStuck, we represent these talents using the Decor system.

As a first level character, you are allowed to choose a Demeanor and one Decor. Your character’s demeanor represents something special about the way they approach a problem, while a decor represents some field of activity your character excels in. Pick the Demeanor and Decor that most appeals to you and fits your character’s interests and hobbies.

A demeanor has keywords. P times per long rest, whenever a player approaches a skill check in a manner that fits a keyword, they gain special 2d8 stakes dice to that check (or all checks during an opposed gambit round).

>[!important] Passion
>Passion represents emotions, confrontation, and personal power. Characters try to answer a problem by meeting it head on, expectant that they can see anything through no matter what gets thrown at them. Its keywords are Confrontation, Power, Emotion, and Sacrifice.

>[!important] Artifice
>Artifice represents ingenuity, trickery, and control. Characters try to answer a problem by circumventing it, subverting circumstances, or otherwise meeting the challenge in an unexpected manner. Its keywords are Finesse, Control, Evasion, and Redirection.

>[!important] Erudition
>Erudition represents knowledge, calculation, and opportunism. Characters try to answer a problem by dissecting it, taking it apart to understand why the problem exists so they can strike straight at the heart of the issue. Its keywords are Calculation, Knowledge, Reason, and Exploitation.

>[!quote] Developers Note: 
>Players can handle the majority of gambits without demeanor, either by their decors or by exceptional roleplay, and P times per long rest is a pittance for how many gambits a player might get into. When, then, does a demeanor come into play? It is the big red emergency button, for the cases where the RNG has not been kind, or the few cases where neither decor nor roleplay is enough. It is a common trope that when one is facing the guns with their backs to the wall, that one can see who they truly are.
