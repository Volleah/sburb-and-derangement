Each psionic power is split into several subpowers, which is a specific, named use of that power, with varying costs and casting times. Knowing a subpower confers knowledge of all abilities listed in that subpower's name. The power itself sets the range, hands used, and any special properties, while the costs, damage dice, and individual effects are stated in the ability used.

Psionics uses a resource called slots. The number of slots the player has is dependent on their level. Psionic powers can be cast without slots, freely, by spending lesser slots, or spending greater slots. Sometimes, time and attention may be the cost, requiring the player to channel the power instead.

Psionics uses a stat, and has a corresponding skill. This stat is chosen at character creation:

- Intelligence has Occult as its psionic skill.
- Wisdom has Sanity as its psionic skill.
- Charisma has Performance as its psionic skill.
- Strength has Athletics as its psionic skill, but psionic powers have their range halved.

Psions and hybrids gain two maximum lesser slots per three levels, while psions have a number of maximum greater slots equal to their Proficiency bonus.

When you use a power, you specify the subpower used. If the subpower has multiple actions listed, you also pick one of those actions to use. If the subpower is an attack, you use your psionic casting modifier (or PCM) for the stat mod, and it will specify if you roll against the target’s AC or a resistance to successfully hit the target. The subpower will also specify its action cost, often being just a major action. If you expend a slot to use a subpower and it is unsuccessful, the slot is still expended.

If a subpower has a casting time beyond a full-round action, including channeling, it requires a major action to be used every turn to continue casting to completion, or the subpower fails with no effects. The power has no effect unless the cast is completed. Any slots used while casting are not expended until the cast is completed; if a channeled subpower has any costs besides time, these are not expended until the channeling is complete either.

A psionic power usually requires one or two free hands. Hand requirements are waived if the caster is using that hand(s) to hold a psionic focus, an item chosen at character creation that the character uses to focus their powers. A psionic focus provides a means for a psionic character to upgrade their powers through alchemy. Your focus may be any object that makes thematic sense, except that it may not also be a weapon or armor.

All psionic powers which are not attacks require line of sight to their target, unless specified otherwise. Psionic attacks are subject to the same difficulties as normal attacks when they can’t see their target.
