>[!quote] “More terms and conditions than your average EULA.”

As a rule of thumb, if a given condition can stack (carry multiple instances of that condition at once), it will be specified in the condition. Otherwise, it does not.

##### Aegis

• A creature with aegis reduces all damage taken by the score listed with the condition.

• The condition's damage reduction stacks with itself from other sources, but the duration of each aegis is tracked independently, unless specified otherwise.

• As it is a form of damage reduction, true damage ignores aegis.

##### Blind

• A blind creature can’t see and automatically fails any skill check that requires sight.

• Blind creatures are impaired and exposed.

##### Crippled

• A crippled creature has its movement speed reduced by the score listed with the condition.

• If a crippled creature would have 0 speed, it is also Stuck.

• Unlike many other conditions, Cripple stacks with itself.

##### Dazed

• A dazed creature loses its minor action on its turn.

• Daze can stack twice. If a creature has two or more instances of Daze, it is also incapable of taking reactions while two or more instances persist.

##### Deafened

• A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any skill check that requires hearing.

##### Doomed

• A doomed creature takes increased damage equal to the score listed with the condition. They take this increased damage once per round per attacker, and the attacker can choose which damage instance to increase (if they have multiple).

• If the damage roll has any percentage bonus damage (such as a critical hit's +100% bonus), the value is added an additional time before applying the bonus.

• Doom stacks with itself from other sources.

• The condition is removed after a short rest.

##### Damage over Time (DOT)

• A creature with a DoT takes damage at the start of each of their turns, for some duration. This damage and duration are listed in the effect’s description.

• DoTs from the same ability and source do not stack unless specified; the highest damage DoT overwrites any others of its kind (e.g. for whatever reason, if two DoTs from the same player using the same ability have different values, the higher one overwrites the lesser one). However, the same DoT from two different players would stack, and applying the same DoT still refreshes its maximum duration on the target.

• DoTs from different sources or different abilities, however, may stack, and each DoT deals its damage separately.

• Some DoTs may have specific names attributed to them (e.g. Pyrokinesis' unique Flame DoT).

##### Empowered

• An empowered creature increases its damage done by the value of one damage mod, listed next to its base damage.

• If the creature is a player, they instead have +2 die size to all damage rolls (or +2P to all flat damage).

##### Exposed

• Attack rolls and skill checks against exposed creatures have advantage.

##### Faded

• A faded creature reduces their resistances by the score listed with the condition.

• The condition does not stack unless specified otherwise. If a newly applied fade is higher in value (at maximum stacks, if it has any) than the current fade condition, the new one overwrites the old one.

• The condition is removed after a short rest.

##### Fire

• Targets that are on fire have a DoT (1d4, true damage). If the fire works differently, it will specify as such in the description of the effect that applied it. This can also apply to names, such as Pyrokinesis' Flame DoT to distinguish it from ordinary fire.

• Targets on fire can spend a minor action to douse the fire with an easily accessible source of water or a major action to smother the fire through other means.

• If no duration is listed, then the fire lasts until put out.

##### Grappled

• A grappled creature is stuck.

• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.

• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as pushing or shoving someone away.

##### Impaired

• An impaired creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and skill checks.

##### Incapacitated

• An incapacitated creature is unable to act. They automatically fail any roll or check (use a 1 if necessary).

##### Intangible

• An intangible creature moves and sees through objects and terrain freely but are unable to interact with the world.

• Intangible creatures cannot make attacks or use psionic powers, but ignore physical attacks.

##### Invisible

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of psionics or some extrasensory ability. They cannot be seen.

•  The creature might still be detected by the noise they make, the tracks they leave behind, their heat/psionic signature, etc, unless the ability by which they became Invisible also addresses them.

• Attack rolls and skill checks against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls and skill checks against others in a strife have advantage.

##### Lethal

• Ordinarily, a creature is out of the fight when they hit 0 hit points, whether they fall unconscious, die, or whatever else.

•  A creature with lethal instead reaches this threshold when their HP reaches the score listed with the condition, or lower.

• Lethal stacks with itself from other sources.

• The condition is removed at the end of a strife. If received out of strife, it lasts 1 minute.

##### Prone

• A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. Standing up costs half of the creature’s base speed.

• The creature has disadvantage on melee attacks.

• Melee attack rolls against the creature have advantage. All other attack rolls have disadvantage.

• Flying creatures that are knocked prone no longer fly, and fall.

##### Regen

• Standing for Regeneration, a creature with Regen regains hit points at the start of each of their turns, for some duration. The healing and duration are listed in the effect’s description.

• Regen from the same ability and source do not stack unless specified; the highest healing Regen overwrites any others of its kind (e.g. for whatever reason, if two Regens from the same player using the same ability have different values, the higher one overwrites the lesser one). However, the same Regen from two different players would stack.

• Regen from different sources or different abilities, however, may stack; unlike its counterpart DoT, multiple Regens heal in one sum instance.

• If a creature has both DoT and Regen, the Regen applies first.

##### Rupture

• A ruptured creature takes increased damage equal to the score listed with the condition whenever they take damage.

• The condition's damage and duration do not stack unless specified otherwise. If a new rupture is applied to an existing rupture (and they don't stack), if the new damage and/or duration is higher than the current one, those higher value(s) overwrite the old one(s). If the new rupture does stack, add it to the current rupture and resolve duration as before.

##### Setback

• A creature with setback has a penalty to all its d20 rolls equal to the score listed.

• The condition does not stack with itself unless specified otherwise. If a new setback is applied to an existing setback (and they don't stack), if the new magnitude and/or duration is higher than the current one, those higher value(s) overwrite the old one(s). If the new setback does stack, add it to the current setback and resolve duration as before.

• The condition is removed at the end of a strife, unless it specifies a different duration. If received out of strife, it lasts 1 minute.

##### Stance

• A creature with a stance has additional effects conferred to it by its stance.

• A stance can typically be entered as a minor action or as part of rolling for initiative, and can be left as a free action. If the stance has any other stipulations related to entering, maintaining, and/or leaving it, it will specify so in its description.

• A creature can only have one stance active at any time.

##### Stasis

• A creature in stasis is frozen in place by some force (such as being frozen in time).

• The creature is unable to act and insensate.

• The creature is immune to damage and ignores any conditions; any conditions or other effects already on them are suspended, but not removed, while in stasis.

##### Stuck

• A Homestuck creature's speed is fixed at 0 and cannot be increased by any means, nor can they move by means other than their move action.

##### Sundered

• A sundered creature reduces their armor class by the score listed with the condition.

• The condition does not stack unless specified otherwise. If a newly applied sunder is higher in value (at maximum stacks, if it has any) than the current sunder condition, the new one overwrites the old one.

• The condition is removed after a short rest.uwu

##### Unconscious

• An unconscious creature falls prone, and is unable to act, insensate, and exposed.

• Any attacks against an unconscious creature automatically hit if made while adjacent to them. Other attacks and abilities might similarly bypass the need to roll, at the SM's discretion.

##### Warded

• A creature with ward reduces all damage taken by the score listed with the condition, and has +2 to Fortitude and Will.

• They can reduce damage taken in this way once per round, but can choose which damage instance to reduce.

• Unless specified, warded lasts indefinitely, and stacks with itself from other sources, though its +2 to Fortitude/Will only stacks twice, to +4.

• As it is a form of damage reduction, true damage ignores wards.

##### Weakened

• A weakened creature reduces its damage done by the value of one damage mod, listed next to its base damage.

• If the creature is a player, they instead have -4 die size to all damage rolls (or -4P to all flat damage).
