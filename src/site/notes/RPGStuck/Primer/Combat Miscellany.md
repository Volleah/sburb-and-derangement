## Hit Points and Stats

Hit Points (HP) determines how much damage your character can withstand before falling unconscious. You have a maximum hit point total; your hit points cannot exceed this, and your hit points are reduced whenever you take damage.

When you hit 0 HP, you fall unconscious. Depending on the circumstances, this may be trouble for your character, though almost all creatures in Sburb do not kill as a first reaction. More often, they will capture you, and you will have to break yourself out. Alternately, your SM may have other, more creative fates in store for you…

However, the Incipisphere is a dangerous place, and Homestuck is no stranger to death. He might even offer you tea. Be careful!

Developer’s Note (3/20/20): Death saving throws are removed from the system. Typically, if the player is unconscious, and whatever felled them wants to kill them, the player is going to die when their attacker stomps them a few times for good measure, saving throws or not. With how rare and ponderous death is in RPGStuck, death has been stripped of its dependence on chance; whereas before, the player might still die even with their attacker sparing them due to unlucky death saving throws, now the player is assumed alive unless the circumstances and/or narrative call for the player’s death.

At level 1, you have maximum HP equal to 10 + Hit Die maximum + Constitution modifier.

As you level up, your max HP increases, by Hit Dice average + Constitution modifier.

Occasionally, you might find your maximum hit points are reduced. Any max HP reduction is restored after a long rest. And occasionally, you might find your stat reduced instead of your hit points. You can heal 1 point of stat damage for each hit die you spend during a short rest, and all stat damage is healed after a long rest. If any of your stats or maximum hit points are reduced to 0, you die instantly.

Developer’s Note (2024-02-24): Due to how the character sheet works, when you reduce maximum hit points, it also reduces your current hit points by the same number. Some effects that ask for a max HP reduction will ask for a corresponding hit point reduction, so you can just reduce your max HP and call it a day. If this isn't the case though, keep this quirk in mind so you don't lose more HP than you should.

Temporary hit points can be gained from a variety of sources, and they represent a short term burst of health. Temporary hit points have a finite duration, and after that time expires any remaining temp HP vanish. Unless otherwise stated, temporary hit points last one hour.

Even if a character is at full hit points, they can still gain temp HP. Temp HP is tracked separately from normal HP, and if a character has temp HP, any damage they take first removes temp HP before removing normal HP if there is any damage left.

If a character already has temp HP and an effect grants them additional temp HP, they do not stack. If the new effect grants more temp HP than the creature already has, then the new temp HP completely replaces the old. Otherwise the new effect does not grant any temp HP.

Occasionally, a player may be able to spend HP as part of a Step or other effect. In this case, the spent HP is always considered to be true damage and bypass all methods of damage reduction.

## Damage Dice

Your abilitechs, subpowers, and other ways of dealing damage have a listed damage value (I hope), with Q or P, a die in parentheses, and a stat mod to add (if any).

This die in the parentheses (e.g. the d6 in 2Qd6+DEX) can be increased, typically through Steps and other abilities you might learn as you play through your session. These will denote that the die size is being increased.

The range of dice sizes goes as such: d2, d3, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, then 2d8, 2d10, 2d12.

- If a damage die size needs to exceed 2d12, you instead add 2P or your Level, of your choice, to the damage roll instead.

- For example, +2 die sizes to a d6 would become d10, for Qd10+DEX, +2 die sizes to a d10 would become 2d8, for 2Qd8+DEX.
- Whereas +1 die size to 2Qd12+STR would become 2Qd12+STR+2P or 2Qd12+STR+Level.
- And +2 die sizes to 2Qd12+STR would become 2Qd12+STR+Level+Level.

- Or 2Qd12+STR+Level+2P, whatever floats your boat.

- If a damage die size ever needs to reduce below d2, you instead subtract P from the damage roll instead.

- The range goes 2d2, 2d3, 2d4, 2d6, then 2d8, 2d10, 2d12 as normal, for some damage rolls whose damage dice don't fall in the scale above.
- Certain damage rolls have dice like 3Qd3, or 3Qd4. The range for these goes 3d2, 3d3, 3d4, 3d6, 3d8, 3d10, 3d12. If it needs to exceed 3d12, add 2P or Level, of your choice, same as above.
- If the damage roll is listed as P or Q damage, you instead add +P or +Q (match the initial damage) to the damage dealt for each time you would raise the die size.
- Any die sizes bonuses only apply to the base damage roll, not any bonus damage added to the initial roll, unless the Step or other effect that adds the bonus specifies as such. Typically, they will specify that it counts as an abilitech and/or subpower.

- The Empower condition is also included in this delineation.

If you have advantage on the damage roll, you roll twice as many damage dice as you normally would, then take the highest number of dice as you would normally roll. Unlike d20s, multiple advantage on damage dice do not stack.

## Aim and Block Dice

Aim and Block dice are dice that can further modify an attack roll. They represent a wide variety of circumstances and actions in a strife that increases (aim) or decreases (block) your odds of landing a hit.

- You have Shieldkind: the action is that you raise your shield to physically block an incoming swing.

Whenever making an attack roll, roll up all Aim dice, or all Block dice, and take the highest die. If you rolled Aim dice, add the die to the roll. If you rolled Block dice, subtract the die from the roll. If you have both, remove one of each until you only have one kind of dice left (or none!).

- You have Shieldkind: as a reaction, you impose a d4 Block die against an incoming attack. Your attacker reduces their attack roll by 1d4.

There are a plethora of ways to get aim dice for your attacks, the easiest being the Aim minor action. There are almost as many ways to throw block dice at your enemies' attacks, the most common being the Block reaction from the Shieldkind specibus. Pillars and Paths contains numerous ways to get both of these.

- You have Shieldkind, Defensive Stance, Bonus Block, and Spirit of Mars: you can impose a d8 Block die against up to two incoming attacks.

The highest an Aim or Block die can go is a d10. If they would go higher, the roll gains +1 per additional die step instead. The lowest it can go is a d2. If it must go lower, the roll takes -1 per additional die step instead.

Other Hit Bonuses/Maluses

Per the Core Rules chapter, anything that adds to or subtracts from an attack roll that isn't Proficiency or stat modifier is considered a hit bonus or malus, depending on whether it adds or subtracts. For example, flat hit bonuses from Pillars and Paths are bonuses, while partial cover acts as a malus.

There is one exception to this, in the +4 or -4 granted from stacking advantage or disadvantage. The bonus/malus from that advantage/disadvantage stack uniquely do not count; they can neither be increased through certain Steps nor ignored through certain abilities.

## Critical Hits, Percentages, Nat 20s, Nat 1s

A critical hit represents a particularly devastating attack that inflicts significantly more damage beyond the norm. Normally, critical hits are made when rolling a 20 on a d20 when making an attack roll.

When you score a critical hit, you either roll twice the normal number of dice on your damage roll and double any modifiers, or make the damage roll as normal, then double the result.

- You score a critical hit on an attack that deals 2d10+STR damage. You instead roll 4d10+2*STR for damage, or roll 2d10+STR and double the result.

- Developer's Note (11/9/2020): The outcomes are the same, but some players take a visceral pleasure in rolling as many dice as possible, some do not.

In terms of percentages, critical hits deal 100% bonus damage. If you have multiple percentages for bonus damage, they are additive and applied after all modifiers.

- You critically hit on a headshot (50% bonus damage) with the 100% damage bonus from Trace. It deals 250% bonus damage: on a damage roll of 10, this becomes 35. Very potent, indeed.
- If an effect says any damage is halved, if the damage has a bonus percentage, reduce the bonus damage first. A critical hit on an attack that deals half damage would consequently still deal 50% bonus damage.
- If a damaging attack lands where it has no bonus damage percentages and it would still be halved twice, it is considered to deal no damage but still counts as a damaging attack in all other regards. An attack cannot go below zero damage in this way.

- Developer's Note (2023-06-18): Note that there's nothing saying you can't stack several half damage effects altogether since damage doesn't go below zero, for the purposes of frontloading all damage penalties. Making the percentages consistent also means critical hits are more effective than before on halved damage abilities, which is… a feature, not a bug, we swear.

There exists a crit range effect; a bonus to crit range decreases the roll required to score a critical hit.

- You have +2 to crit range. You now score critical hits on a d20 attack roll of 18-20 instead of only 20.

Whenever you roll a 20 on a d20 while making an attack roll, this is called a nat 20. A nat 20, in addition to being a critical hit, automatically hits its target(s) regardless of the target's AC or resistance.

- Developer's Note (2022-11-25): In practice, there are very few cases where the player could roll a 20 on a d20 and still miss the target. This is primarily a holdover from DnD that nobody's ever seen fit to excise, and for good reason. We love our crits.

Whenever you roll a 1 on a d20 while making an attack roll, this is called a nat 1 or a critfail. A nat 1 is definitely not a critical hit, and always misses its target(s) regardless of the target's AC or resistance.

- Developer's Note (2022-11-25): Unlike nat 20s, there can be some cases where a player can roll a 1 on their d20 and still hit their target. However, the visceral horror associated with rolling a 1 isn't something we're keen to dissuade. The only ones who should roll dice are those prepared to accept a 1.

Developer's Note (2022-11-25): Nat 20s and nat 1s technically only apply to attack rolls, and not to skill checks. This does not, however, stop some SMs from using them for those anyway, particularly for nat 1s on skill checks representing a spectacular and hopefully hilarious form of failure. The developers have no formal opinion on this, go nuts or not as your group desires.

## Called Shots and Anatomy

You can make called shots, where you attempt to target specific parts of a target's anatomy, in exchange for having to roll against a higher AC/resistance and lowered crit range.

Before making an attack roll against a target, you may declare that you will make a called shot against some specific part of that target. If this attack still lands, then you also trigger whatever effects occur whenever that part is hit.

If the part has hit points of its own, separate from the target's overall hit points, it can also be grappled, but the target can add that part's bonus to AC/resistance to any checks to avoid having it grappled. If these hit points are depleted, the part is destroyed and any leftover damage spills over to the target's overall hit points.

There several types of common anatomical parts that can be targeted, given in the format of Part (X) (+Y). X is how many of that part they have (if only one, this is omitted). Y is the bonus to the target's defenses and a penalty to the attack's crit range, minimum 20.

- You have a crit range of +2 (crit on a d20 attack roll of 18-20), and your target's AC is 14. You choose to go for the Head (+4). The AC is now 18, and your crit range is now -2 (minimum 20 meaning you're back to crits only on nat 20s).

#### Common Called Shot Targets

- Head (+4): Attacks against the head deal 50% bonus damage. Critical hits against the head deal an extra 50% bonus damage.

- Wings (+4): Creatures with wings lose flight for 1 round if their wings are hit or grappled.

- Alternately, it may have hit points and permanently remove flight from the target if destroyed, such as the Wolf-Chancellor's jetpack.

- Arm (+2): If the target is grappling someone with this arm when it is damaged, the grappler must immediately make a grappling check against the attack roll to maintain it, otherwise the grapple is released. If the target isn't grappling anyone, they have disadvantage to attempt a grapple for 1 round.

- Some creatures, like the Basilisk, have a Tail that serves the same purpose.
- And others, like the Landshark, have Jaws for the same purpose.

- Leg (+2): Attacks against the leg that inflict any effect besides damage also inflict Cripple (10) for 1 round. Since Cripple stacks with itself, a crippling strike against the legs can seriously slow someone.

- Some creatures, like Basilisks, have four or more legs. In these cases, at least half the target's legs must be targeted and affected. See below for details.

- Tool (+2 to +6): Some creatures, like carapacians, carry around weapons, shields, psionic focii, or other types of tools. These have hit points, so they can be destroyed or grappled. Additionally, forced movement effects knock tools out of their wielder's hands for the given distance.

The following types of attacks cannot make called shots:

- Attacks that automatically hit.
- Area of effect attacks.
- Attacks that still deal damage or other effects on a miss.
- Attacks that use skill checks to hit.

There are also secret called shots. To make a called shot on a secret, you first need to locate it on that target using Discern or Scrutinize on them, ideally before the strife begins. The difficulty of this check is based on the target's DC.

When you make a called shot, after taking the crit penalty, if you still have crit range on the attack equal to or greater than the AC/resistance bonus, you can reduce your crit range by that bonus to nullify the AC/resist bonus.

- You have a crit range of +9 (crit on a d20 attack roll of 11-20), and your target's AC is 20. You choose to go for the Head (+4). The AC is now 24, and your crit range is now +5 (crit on 15-20). You choose to trade your crit range to ignore the AC bonus. You now have +1 crit range (crit on 19-20) but the target's AC drops back to 20.

The ability to make a called shot on one target does not carry over to the next; it's easy to know that every Basilisk has a shatterpoint on its hide, or every Carapacian Bishop has a psi focus on them, but no two Basilisks are guaranteed to have one in the same spot. Secret called shots represent some type of vulnerability that is common to all creatures of its type, but unique to the individual.

Some types of anatomy, such as legs on quadrupeds, require that multiple copies be hit at once to cause an effect. When it comes to targeting multiple called shots at once on a target, it depends on the method used. Area of effects cannot make called shots, so only abilities that make multiple attacks can be used. More specifically, you must use an ability that lets you target the same target multiple times, then target a different copy with each of them.

- Developer's Note (2022-12-11): In practice, most players won't have the tools to make this happen. Turns out all those legs aren't just for show. They'll have to cripple them the old fashioned way.

#### Common Secret Called Shots Types

- Psi Core (+2): Attacks against the psi core deal 50% bonus damage, just like headshots, and are easier to pull off, but only psionic attacks can target them. Typically, only psionic creatures will have them.

- Artery (+4): This represents what it sounds like. The DC for spotting this is higher than normal, and it has hit points. If this is destroyed, the target gains a permanent DoT that can only be removed by being psionically healed or two Medicine checks.

- This also represents fuel lines on many mechanical carapacian constructs. In this case, swap out healing and Medicine with repairs and Engineering.

- Developer's Note (10/29/2020): Or specify psionic healing and swap Medicine with Occult for psionic creatures. This variant isn't in the bestiary as of this writing, but the possibility exists, if your SM is of that bent.

- If they do somehow cauterize their bleeding wounds shut, just hit them there again to resume the bloodletting.

- Opening (+0): This represents some weakness within the creature's strife techniques that you use against them. Attacks against this have +2 to hit.

- Shatterpoint (+0): This represents some weak, brittle spot on a creature, and is no harder to hit than a normal, uncalled attack. Attacks against this part have +2 crit range, and critical hits Daze the target for 1 round.

- Vitals (+2): This represents some soft, vulnerable part of a creature. It can be grappled, despite not having hit points, and creatures whose vitals are damaged or grappled are Dazed for 1 round or as long as the grapple lasts.

- Tools (+2 to +6): No different than their more visible counterparts above, though psionic focii tend to be more secret than not.

## Grappling with Grappling

Grappling is a major action with at least one free hand that attempts to seize the target with an opposed check, your Athletics versus the target's Athletics/Acrobatics. Alternately, it can refer to the target attempting to escape a grapple, using their Athletics/Acrobatics against the grappler's Athletics.

For ease of terminology, you will be used to refer to the one initiating and holding the grapple, and the target to refer to the one being grappled and trying to escape.

Checks to initiate a grapple has disadvantage the target is a larger size category than you. You have disadvantage again (for double disadvantage) if the creature is three or more size categories larger. This is typically Gargantuan size for a Medium player.

Conversely, you have disadvantage to grapple a target and their mount if you aren't two or more size categories larger than either of them. This is also typically Gargantuan size, as most player mounts are Large.

If a creature you are currently grappling has any held/worn items, or has anatomy/features with hit points, you may attempt to grapple that specific item/anatomy, seizing it on a success.

Your speed is ordinarily halved while grappling one or more creatures, but any forms of movement that do not rely on your speed (such as moving through a minor action) are unaffected.

- If you teleport while grappling a target, the target moves with you.

Your target cannot normally move by any means, including through means other than a move action, of their own volition. If they (or anyone else) successfully inflicts forced movement on you, you let go of the grapple, unless either you have a Step or other effect that lets you bring them with you, or you are still within grappling range from your new location.

- However, they can move if the movement is teleportation, in which case they escape your grapple as part of the movement.

Many creatures who grapple can have their grappling appendage directly struck to attempt to break the grapple. If a given limb/anatomy is strikable in this way, it will specify itself as such on its stat block. If a creature is using multiple appendages/limbs, all of those limbs must be simultaneously hit to qualify.

- Switching arms in/out of grappling is a free action, though if the grappler ever has no arms on the grappled target, the grapple is broken.

If you and the target are both flying and in a grapple, neither side can fall unless:

- The grapple ends.
- Both sides are made to fall (such as an effect that knocks them Prone).
- If the target is made to fall, you can voluntarily release the grapple, fall with them, or pass an Athletics check (against the attack roll that caused the effect, or DC if no roll is given) to keep them afloat. Failing this check causes you to fall with them.
- If you are made to fall, the target goes with you.

If you are grappling multiple targets, everyone is dragged with you. Each target's grapple is tracked separately; if some ability affects a target, it does not affect the other grappled targets, while if something affects you, it affects your grapple in relation to all your targets.

- If you voluntarily give up a grapple, you can choose which to give up.
- If involuntary, you give up all grapples.

If you want to move a grappled target into another space within range, you must expend speed equal to how far you moved them. This counts as forced movement for the target but cannot be used to deal fall damage.

- If you have multiple targets grappled, you can move each target for however much speed you expended.

If you are grappling a target at a range beyond the 5 ft. melee range, track how far they are from you when you first grappled them.

- You grapple a target at 10 feet. When you move, they move with you, remaining 10 feet away in relation to you.

If you can grapple by other means (such as a minion grappling on your behalf or psionic means), assume it uses the same skills to check unless the other means specifically states otherwise.

## Bestiary Intro

You'll be facing off against all sorts of opponents in your time in the Incipisphere, from underlings of all shapes, sizes, and dental health, to carapacians and their assortment of imposing war machines. You'll want to go to the [Bestiary](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IOVGiA6tC30eZ1Bolbxkp3EOkltjwBG3rpt2NzDJyCU/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730014258180445&usg=AOvVaw1AdzJQEEXABU7LenMc7h7m) for the full details, but here's a very brief overview of what you might want to know.

#### Hordes and Swarms

Hordes represent one of two things: a cluster of creatures that act as a singular being in combat, or a creature that degrades rapidly as it takes damage.

Hordes deal significantly lower damage with each attack, though they land an additional hit for every 5 by which their attack roll exceeds your defenses. Furthermore, they have a special trait, Horde Strength, that grants them +10 to hit, and their hit point totals are far higher than other creatures of their level.

However, they also have a unique Horde Anatomy:

- Whenever making an attack with multiple targets (such as Swordkind's Cleave), each of those attacks may target the Horde.
- Alternately, if making an area of effect attack, it hits the Horde once per 5 ft. square the Horde occupies in that area.

- If making an attack that hits everything within a certain radius, line, etc, it hits the Horde once per 5 ft. square in reach.
- If the Horde itself is Medium and only occupies one 5 ft. square at all, any area of effect attacks hit it three times instead.

- Or if making an attack that makes one attack per target in range, it hits the Horde once per 5 ft. square the Horde occupies.

- If the Horde itself is Medium and only occupies one 5 ft. square at all, it may be treated as three targets for this purpose.

Furthemore, Horde Strength decreases to +5 at two-thirds of the Horde's HP, and disappears entirely at one-third HP. Combined with their vulnerability from Horde Anatomy, Hordes are glass cannons who can dish out the pain (unless their target has Aegis) but are uniquely fragile in return.

#### Combat Rating (CR)

Not all monsters of the same tier are made equal. Monsters are classified by their tier and their CR. A breakdown of the CRs:

- CR 1: Imps, for example.
- CR 2: Ogres, Basilisks, etc.
- CR 3: Minibosses (especially powerful enemies).
- CR 4: Adversaries (like Denizens, the Black King, etc).

A player in any given tier will want to start off with CR 1, moving onto CR 2 as they get the hang of things. As they alchemize gear of their current tier, they'll be ready for CR 3, though they'll want all of it ready before tackling CR 4.

When designing an encounter, just add the CR of all its participants:

- Encounter has two CR 1 Imps? It's a CR 2 encounter.
- Throwing a CR 2 Ogre and a CR 1 Imp? It's a CR 3 encounter.
- Three CR 2 Ogres? It's a CR 6 encounter and you should probably ask yourself if there's a more stylish way your player might be destroyed.

A monster from one tier higher counts as twice its CR, while a monster one tier lower counts as half its CR.

- Do you hate your player? They're Tier 1? Throw eight Tier 0 CR 1 imps at them, this would be a CR 4 encounter.
- Do you also hate your player? They're Tier 2? A single Tier 3 CR 2 Acheron would also be a CR 4 encounter for them.

#### Damage (base) and Mods

Just as you've likely noticed attacks that Daze or Cripple do less damage than basic attacks, the same applies for the other side. A Basilisk's Bite may do more damage than their Tail Whip, but it also grapples on hit.

Every monster in RPGStuck has a base damage and a damage mod. While the majority of damage rolls for a given attack are given, monsters may have abilities that require them to subtract or add damage mods. For example, any monster can Assail to add an extra damage mod, same as players.

However, the Weakened condition can force monsters to reduce their damage by their mod. Just as the Aegis condition is more effective against weak but numerous attacks, inflicting Weakened can heavily penalize singular, high-damage attacks.

#### Terms and Things to Know

All monsters can perform the same range of actions available to players in the Primer, with certain changes:

- Assail always adds the monster's damage mod, instead of a stat mod.

- Developer's Note (11/02/2020): Every monster has a minor action and can Assail. Or Aim to edge out a hit. Better get your Dazes ready!

- Certain attacks have the multiattack (X) tag. An attack with this makes X attack rolls instead, resolving each one separately.
- They might have the Cooldown (X) tag. An attack with this must wait X rounds without being used before it can be used again.
- Developer's Note (10/30/2020): If more get added or found to not be easily grasped, they'll be added here as time goes on.

## Light and Darkness

Anticipating danger, spotting hidden objects, and strife tend to assume that there is bright light and everyone can see. This is not always true, as the night can attest; darkness is a potent inhibition.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured.

- Light obscuration, such as dim light, fog, or gunsmoke, imposes disadvantage on any sight-based Perception checks.
- Heavy obscuration, such as darkness, makes any creatures within it effectively unable to be seen.

As a rule of thumb, if the target can still be seen or their outline can be made out, it counts as light obscuration. If the target is wholly obscured and cannot be seen, heavy obscuration.

An area can have bright light, dim light, or darkness.

- Bright light is the norm; Most lands, Prospit, and locations that bask in Skaia's light are considered to be in bright light. Torches, lanterns, a blast of pyrokinetic fire or flash of electrokinetic lightning can also provide bright light.
- Dim light creates light obscuration. The alleyways of Derse are often dimly lit for that violet noir aesthetic.
- Darkness creates heavy obscuration. Dark, dank dungeons and vaults deep within the Lands and Veil, areas of magical darkness, and the Furthest Ring are shrouded in darkness.

When you attack a target that you cannot see, as a rule of thumb, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, whether you are guessing their location or targeting a creature you have perceived using other senses like echolocation or psi sight. Obviously, if the attack is not targeted at your intended target’s actual location, you will miss the attack and your SM will tell you such, but they will not tell you if you guessed their location correctly or not.

## Stealth Shenanigans

Being sneaky has benefits like having the initiative and engaging on your terms. Also not being perceived, which is nice.

In general, if you want to be stealthy and sneak around, make sure nobody has line of sight on you. This can typically be done through heavy obscuration such as darkness (see Light and Darkness later in this section) or full cover (see Environmental Factors also in this section), though other examples like psionic illusions and notably invisibility also work.

Stealth checks are called for to abstract the various details that come around with sneaking around. The sound of footsteps, breathing, clothes, and all these other details are condensed into a Stealth check when someone or something is around to hear, see, or otherwise sense you. A success means you are stealthy enough to remain undetected, while a failure means you are not and have been detected in some way.

Developer's Note (2022-10-23): We'll likely add more to this section as the stealth rework goes live, given its perennially finicky nature.

## Special Types of Movement

There are other ways to get around in Sburb besides stomping the pavement.

Generally, alternate forms of movement take an additional foot of speed spent per foot moved. For example, while climbing or swimming, all distance takes twice the effort to travel, meaning that climbing 5 feet up a hill takes up 10 feet of movement.

When jumping, assuming a 10 foot running start beforehand, a character can jump a horizontal distance a number of feet equal to their Strength stat and a vertical distance equal to 3+STR feet. If there is no charge beforehand, they halve any distance jumped. All movement used this way uses a regular amount of movement. At their discretion, the SM might ask the player for an Athletics check to jump a greater distance than permitted under these rules.

Flying typically does not have any special restrictions. A character’s fly/flight speed in their dreamself is equal to their base speed.

When teleporting from place to place, there are two requirements. First, you must be able to see where you are teleporting. Secondly, the place you are teleporting to must be unoccupied.

Moving while mounted uses the mount’s speed instead of the rider’s. Mounting and dismounting takes half the rider’s currently used speed (typically, mounting takes the rider’s speed, dismounting takes the mount’s speed).

## Environmental Factors

Far be it from the varied landscapes of the Incipisphere to only have blank, featureless rooms.

While under cover, a creature has increased defences.

- You have half cover for +2 AC/Reflex if an intervening object between an attacker and yourself covers at least half your body from them.
- You have three-fourths cover for +4 AC/Reflex if an intervening object between an attacker and yourself covers at least three-fourths of your body from them.
- You have full cover to be untargetable and out of sight if you are completely shielded from them, such as a wall that they can’t actually see you through.

A creature can hold its breath for 1+CON minutes, and can survive for CON (min 1) rounds if out of breath. At the start of its next turn after the aforementioned number of rounds has passed, they drop to 0 hit points regardless of prior hit points. If they still cannot breathe after this, they will likely die momentarily after.

At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet it fell. If they are forcibly moved and impact with a hard surface, they take P damage (or T if a monster inflicts it) per 5 feet they had left to move.

- For example, if a T3 Titachnid would push a creature back 35 feet but the creature hits a wall after 10 feet, the 25 feet of movement it was unable to move deals 15 damage.
- If a player then slammed the Titachnid for 30 feet and it hit a wall after 20 feet, the 10 feet of movement left would deal 2P damage.

If a creature is forcibly moved into another creature instead, use the same attack roll or check for the first creature on the second, splitting the damage taken evenly between the two if the second would take on a hit, failed check, etc. If it would not be hit or otherwise affected, the first creature still stops their movement adjacent to the second creature, but only the first creature takes the full damage.

- If a player Shoved an Imp into a second Imp, and the first Imp would take 2P damage, the second Imp may make an opposed check against your initial Shove check. If it fails, both Imps each take P damage. If it passes, only the first Imp takes 2P damage.
- If the second creature cannot be moved through, it is automatically hit.
- If two creatures are pushed into each other with the same ability, such as Fncysntakind, they automatically hit each other as well. Pool the damage both parties would take and evenly split the damage taken.

- If more than two parties would simultaneously collide, pool the damage all parties involved would take and evenly distribute the damage among them.
- If multiple parties crash into another creature but the multiple parties only share contact with the center creature, only the individual pairs of those multiple parties and the center creature take damage.

- For example, if four Imps are pushed into a Giclops from cardinal directions, and each Imp would normally take 2P damage, each Imp's impact into the Giclops splits it into P damage for the Imp and P for the Giclops, for a total of P damage for each Imp and four instances of P damage for total 4P for the Giclops.

- Developer’s Note (2023-02-15): We don't expect this to happen often, but the community wanted to be able to do slapstick like this.

## Mounted Combat

Sometimes, you have to be the rider.

You may ride an adjacent, willing creature of at least one size category larger than you (a Medium rider may ride a Large creature) by spending half your speed to get on. Such creatures typically require Animal Handling checks and one free hand to control it, though this is ultimately up to your SM.

While mounted the rider uses the mount’s movement speed in place of their own, including base speed. If the mount is knocked Prone, the rider falls Prone adjacent to it; they can use a reaction to negate becoming Prone. If the rider is knocked Prone or hit with forced movement, they are also dismounted. If the rider is knocked Unconscious, if there are no allies present, the mount will typically attempt to abscond.

Mounts share the same initiative as its rider; the mounted creature can still use actions on its turn (if it has any), besides movement.

Saddlekind has its own, additional rules, like forgoing the Animal Handling checks and allowing two-handed melee and special weapons to be used with one hand in exchange for a hit malus. Consult the saddlekind specibus for more information.

## Minions

And sometimes you have… whatever the heck Lil Cal is.

Some specibi and specializations can give you creatures and objects that fight under your control, while certain psionic powers can summon creatures to similar effect. In these cases and more, where you can control these other creatures and objects, these creatures/objects are collectively referred to as minions.

Minions from specibi, such as Saddlekind, count as allies while they are present and on the field, for the purposes of Steps and other effects that benefit allies. However, whenever you use any abilitechs with these specibi, it counts as you and not an ally, as you are the one actually acting through the minion; these minions are just a tool in your hands in this case, no different than a sword or a needle or a gun.

Minions from other sources, such as the Companion specialization or psionic powers, always count as allies, even if you command them to act a certain way; these minions are their own, independent creatures. They never benefit from your own Steps or other benefits unless they explicitly extend to your allies or minions.

## Resting and Limited Abilities

A short rest is up to an hour of calm, non-intensive activities (napping, reading, sitting around, playing videogames). You may spend and roll hit dice (rolling hit dice also assumes any modifiers, such as Constitution, are added), then heal for that many hit points. You also regenerate as many lesser slots as hit dice you spent. You spend an amount of time equal to the hit dice spent in proportion to your total hit dice.

- Any effects, abilities, resources, or others that rely on a short rest (such as those that recharge on one) only work if the player spends at least P hit dice in one sitting.

At full HP and resources, a player can expect to go through two, three, or more strifes before wanting to think about a short rest. Uncontrollable factors such as a lucky streak on the dice or the sadistic dicebots screwing them over, can influence this, as well as controllable factors such as the player strifing defensively, taking HP-restoring steps, etc.

A long rest is 8 hours or longer. Typically, the player will sleep and be in their dreamself during this time. If this is interrupted by an hour’s interruption or longer, the rest cannot confer any benefit. At the end of a long rest, the player regains all lost hit dice, hit points, and slots. Players can only benefit from one long rest per 24 hours and must have at least 1 hit point to gain the benefits of the rest.

#### Limited Use Abilities

Certain abilities specify they may only be used per strife, or per short/long rest. A strife-limited ability may only be used so many times that strife, and cannot be used again until the next strife. A rest-limited ability, once used up, cannot be used again until the corresponding rest has been taken.

If a limited use ability relies on a roll (such as an attack roll or skill check) to activate, if the ability is used but the roll fails and the ability fails to activate, it is not considered used.

- If a player uses a once per short rest ability that requires them to make a skill check against the target's Will, and the check fails so the ability fails to activate, while the action used to make it is wasted, the ability is not considered used and may be reused.
- If some part of the ability still activates, however, such as Psi Pulse, it is still considered used.
- If the ability targets multiple targets or makes multiple attacks, and it fails on most targets/attacks but not all, it is still considered used.

The ability must either specify it is strife or rest limited in its description, or come from a Path or other source (such as alchemy) that uses a rest-dependent resource (regenerates after a rest, is limited in usage, etc).

- Psi Pulse, as mentioned above, still has an effect even if all (if any) attack rolls miss, so it will always be considered used.
- The likes of Sanguine: Brave will always be usable, as nothing exists in the system that prevents the player from performing all (or any, really) those actions. Hypothetically, if something did, it would have to prevent all four of those actions (movement, Aim, Avert, Assail) to not be considered spent.
- Psionic slot usage, whether from powers or PnP, would not fall under this, as they cost slots but are not technically limited by a strife/rest within their descriptions.
- Abilities that provide their own resources and typically require skill checks, such as Dancer, Infernal, or Thaumaturge, do fall under this, as those Paths grant a resource that regenerates on some rest. However, the ability must fail entirely to not be considered spent; if it still has some effect even on a failure, it is still considered spent.
