## Build-A-Char Checklist

The process for creating a character takes some time, let’s settle in with a checklist first.

- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Identity\|#Identity]]:** Who is the character? What are they like? What’s their backstory?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Race\|#Race]]:** Is your character a human or a troll? If a troll, what blood caste?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Stats\|#Stats]]:** What is your character capable of?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Psionics\|#Psionics]]:** Can your character use psionic powers or not?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Pillar\|#Pillar]]:** What sort of archetype does your character fit?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Strife Specibi, Armor, and Accessories\|#Strife Specibi, Armor, and Accessories]]:** What sort of weapons and armor does your character use?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Skills and Proficiencies\|#Skills and Proficiencies]]:** What does your character do well?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Decors, Demeanor, and Specialization\|#Decors, Demeanor, and Specialization]]:** What’s notable about your character?
- **[[RPGStuck/Primer/Character Creation#Miscellaneous\|#Miscellaneous]]:** All the little details!

>[!important] As a rule of thumb, all the cells you should directly edit on the sheet are colored white. Anything else you should leave alone so the sheet’s code can work its magic.

#### Overview

Let’s look at what the character sheet looks like first, it has a lot of moving parts.

- **Character:** This is the main sheet, and it holds all the stats, numbers, and items you’ll need to play.
- **Biography:** What’s your character like? Their Identity goes in here.
- **Mechanics:** Numbers and guts! When you’re setting up your character (so the majority of the generation checklist), and whenever they level up, you’ll be fiddling with these bits in here!
- **Strife Deck:** Your character’s strife specibi and psionic foci go in here.
- **Wearables:** Your character’s wardrobes go in here.
- **Atheneum:** The rest of your character’s alchemy can be logged in here.
- **Household:** Your character’s house, followers, and boondollar ledger can be managed from here.
- **Customization:** If you need to reconfigure your specibi, powers, or Steps, reskin them, add your custom ones, or just rearrange them in a way that the rest of the sheet won’t allow, you can do it here.

## Identity

Your character needs an identity! Starting with a core concept for your character is a great place to start to figure out how to begin creating them. Some characters are more rugged and outdoorsy, others are acrobats, others scholars and scientists. Figure out what type of character you want and then you can go from there. Here are some questions you can answer to get you started! What race are they? Are they a human or a troll? What is your character’s gender? How old are they? What do they look like? What is their chat handle? What defining personality traits do they have? The race, and blood color if applicable, you choose for your character will affect how well your character can do different things, so you can also hold off on deciding for sure until you read the racial benefits below!

## Race

We’ll begin with the basics. Do you want to play a human? Or a troll? RPGStuck has unique traits for humans and all twelve castes in the troll hemospectrum. Depending on the race you choose, your character will receive related bonuses and penalties to their stats (we’ll go over what those do later), a capacity for slots (used for powering psionic abilities-we’ll get to those next), and at least one racial feature, an ability or option that can only be selected during character creation. In general, lower blood caste races receive bonuses to psionics and increased vulnerability to psionics in turn, higher blood races receive severe penalties to psionics but higher defenses against the same, and midbloods receive a compromise of these two.

Reference the table below, which contains all of the racial traits, and the descriptions of racial features that follow. When you know what you want to play, stat adjustments and psionic slots can be marked down on the Mechanics tab in the character sheet (for ability scores, use the column marked Racial), while the tab has space below the stats to mark your choice of race.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Color|Features|
|Burgundy|Has +1 INT, +1 to a stat of choice and Psionic Gift or Lowblood|
|Bronze|Has +1 WIS, +1 to a stat of choice and Sanguine or Lowblood|
|Gold|Has +2 INT and Presence of Mind or Lowblood|
|Lime|Has +1 CHA, +1 to a stat of choice, and Social Expert or Lowblood|
|Olive|Has +2 DEX and Apex Predator or Midblood|
|Jade|Has +2 CHA and Life and Death or Midblood|
|Teal|Has +2 to a stat of choice and On Patrol or Midblood|
|Cerulean|Has +1 CHA, +1 to a stat of choice and Vivacity or Midblood|
|Indigo|Has +2 STR and Ruffiannihilate or Highblood|
|Purple|Has +1 CON, +1 to a stat of choice and High Fever or Highblood|
|Violet|Has +1 DEX, +1 to a stat of choice, Amphibious, and Harbinger or Highblood|
|Fuchsia|Has +1 to any two different stats of choice, Amphibious, and Iron Will or Highblood|
|Human|Has +1 to a stat of choice, +1 to another stat of choice, Childhood|

**Amphibious:** Your swim speed is equal to your normal speed, and you can breathe in air and water.

Alternately, if this isn't your first rodeo, you might consider taking a variant that's associated with an archetype over a specific blood caste.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Variant|Features|
|Spirited Scrapper|Has +1 STR, +1 to a stat of choice and High Fever: Berserk, Ruffiannihilate, or Vivacity: Killing Flair|
|Street Smarts|Has +2 WIS and Vivacity: All-Seeing Eye, Social Expert, or Childhood: Had to be Sharp|
|Stalwart Scales|Has +2 CON and Autoparry, Iron Will, or Highblood: Refresher|

There’s a lot more racials this time around.

|Life and Death: Cut to Size|Once per short rest, when you land a damaging attack, after all bonuses and multipliers to damage are added, you force it to deal additional true damage equal to a tenth of the target's maximum hit points. The target is then Weakened for 1 minute.|
|On Patrol|You learn the following maneuvers, and can use one per round as a free action.<br><br>>Hammershot: When you land a damaging attack, the target is also Dazed for 1 round.<br><br>>Fieldcraft: When you make a skill check against a target’s resistance, you add +3 to the check.<br><br>>Fortify: Whenever you are in cover, increase any defensive bonuses from it by +2 until you move again.|

## Stats

By now, your character is starting to take shape, and it’s high time we talk about Stats. Every character has six of them— some they are good at, one or two they are great at, and one or two they are rather miserable at using. When creating a new character, you have access to six numbers known as a Standard Array:

>[!important] 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8

You may assign these scores to your character however you like. On the Mechanics tab of your sheet, enter the above numbers under the column marked Initial once you know where you would like to allocate them. Note that these are combined with the modifiers granted by your racial features, and the sheet will fill out the final score (or modifier, derived from your score) throughout the sheet automatically.

But what do the stats mean? Let’s give a quick rundown, shall we?

>[!info] Strength (STR) Strength
Strength is a measure of your raw physical power-how hard you punch, how much you lift, and so on. If your character fights in melee a lot, likes grappling things, or must be the strongest kid alive, you may want to invest in this.

>[!info] Constitution (CON)
Constitution does one thing, and one thing well-it dictates how difficult it is to kill your character. If you want to be hardy with tons of HP and absorb hits (and also if you like heavy armor), invest here. ...really, you should always try to invest a little in not dying, it’s a good practice.  

>[!info] Dexterity (DEX)
Dexterity measures your agility and reflexes: moving quietly, accurately firing a gun, doing acrobatic flips off of handles, and so on. If your character uses ranged or finesse weapons, likes sneaking, or needs fast hands, consider investing in this.

>[!info] Intelligence (INT)
Intelligence represents your character’s ability to learn. High INT characters are full of facts and information, can be quite studious, and rely on brains over brawn. It is also the default PCM for psionic powers, so if you fancy your character a psion, don’t forget this score!

>[!info] Wisdom (WIS)
Wisdom is the knowledge and experience your character has acquired. Street smarts, to INT’s book smarts. WIS gets a hefty amount of skills assigned to it, including the ability to spot things quickly, read people, use survival skills, or give medical aid. Also, psions sometimes use this score as their PCM.

>[!info] Charisma (CHA)
Contrary to popular belief, Charisma ain’t about looking pretty. It’s about your ability to be aware of and act in social situations. It’s knowing when to speak, what to say, how to perform, and establishing and projecting your presence as you choose. Most social skills are CHA skills, naturally. And like WIS, some psions use CHA as their PCM.

>[!info] Proficiency (Prof, P)
This isn't one of the six stats, but it's as important as one. Proficiency is a catch-all that represents your abilities, beyond your stats. It starts at +2, and goes up by +1 every five levels. Anything that refers to your Proficiency bonus or just P is referring to this. You'll be seeing this a lot, from how powerful an ability is to how often you can use one.

## Psionics

Next, we’ll discuss psionics. Does your character have cool mind powers? Do they focus on mastery of their chosen specibus? Or do they maybe dabble in a little of both?

If your character is psionic, they have access to powers and slots. If your character is psionic, they have a psionic casting stat (PCS)! This stat can be picked on the Mechanics tab of the character sheet, and you can choose from Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, or Strength, each coming with an associated psionic skill. Each power is a collection of several subpowers; knowing a subpower confers knowledge of all abilities listed with that subpower's name, which can come in the following varieties:

- An at-will (or slotless) subpower may be cast without expending any resources, outside of the time needed to cast it. It is the weakest option.
- A lesser slot subpower is cast by expending a lesser slot, which is a limited resource a psion may regain during rests. This is slightly more powerful than an at-will casting.
- A greater slot subpower is cast by expending a greater slot, a highly limited resource that psions only regain after a long rest, meaning at the end of a full day. This is the strongest option.
- A channeled subpower requires more time to cast; typically a power can be used in the space of a turn, but a few require some time. This may or may not also require slots on top, but generally a channeled power trades slot costs for time costs.

Interested? If so, select psion or hybrid from the options below, adjust your sheet as detailed, make a box or two from Resources to hold your slot capacity, and continue further down to pick out your powers! Not interested? Select martial from the options below, adjust your sheet, and skip straight to picking out your specibi and armor!

#### Psion
Your character relies on their immense psionic talents to defend themselves, but can be somewhat physically frail and susceptible to mental assaults. You gain the following benefits and penalties:

- You have both greater slots and lesser slots.
- You have Psi Vulnerability (-4 to Will resistance).
- You gain access to two powers:

- You know all subpowers from one of these powers.
- You know one subpower from the other power; whenever you gain a Step, you can learn one unknown subpower per psionic power you know (which would be at least two).

- You do not normally learn any special abilitechs for your specibi. (you may learn them through means such as Steps and specializations)
- -1 die size to all abilitechs.
- You gain a psionic focus: a small trinket you carry or wear which helps you focus your powers (such as a pair of glasses or a tiara).

#### Hybrid
Your character strikes a balance between psionic and physical prowess. While maybe not being as powerful in either individual area as others may be, you learn to grow and adapt with time. You gain the following benefits and penalties:

- You have lesser slots.
- You have Psi Vulnerability (-4 to Will resistance).
- You gain access to one power and you know one subpower from it.
- You know one special abilitech per specibus.
- As you level, you gain the ability to learn additional subpowers and special abilitechs: whenever you gain a Step, you can learn one unknown subpower or abilitech per power or strife specibus you know.

- You do not need to evenly distribute this learning between all powers and specibi; for example, if you know three powers and two specibi, you might choose to learn five unknown subpowers from one power instead, or split them across unknown subpowers/abilitechs as desired.

- Whenever you gain a Decor, you gain 1 skill point.
- +1 die size to your Hit Die.
- You gain a psionic focus: a small trinket you carry or wear which helps you focus your powers (such as a pair of glasses or a tiara).

#### Martial
Your character has no psionic talents. Instead, you are able to wield your specibus with ease and power, and are physically sturdier. You gain the following benefits and penalties:

- You know no powers or subpowers and have no lesser or greater slots.
- You know all abilitechs for strife specibi you are proficient in (see strife specibus section below).
- Whenever you gain a Step, you gain 2 skill points. Whenever you gain a Stage, you increase the magnitude of its benefit by 1.
- +1 die size to your Hit Die.

## Pillar

In many tabletop games, this would be around the time when you select a class for your character (no no, not like Heir or Prince, more like Fighter or.. ...Bard. Shoosh). In RPGStuck, however, we have created something more flexible, called Pillars and Paths (PnP).

As a first level character, you are entitled to select your Pillar and unlock your first Milestone. Pick the Pillar below that most appeals to you (and hopefully complements the choices you have made so far!) and make note of it on the Character tab of your sheet, under the Pillars and Paths section. If a Pillar has more than one Milestone listed, you may select whichever one you like.

## Strife Specibi, Armor, and Accessories

Every character begins play at level one knowing how to use one strife specibus. They also have their armor, or wardrobe. Both start at Tier 0.

On the Mechanics tab, you can choose what two stats the armor uses when calculating your Armor Class. Maybe you’re fast and smart and you use your DEX and INT to avoid blows. Or you’re hearty like an ox and wise like the owl, and you use CON and WIS. Or you’re strong and gorgeous and the world hates to see you marred, so you use STR and CHA. The only limitation is that only Sentinels can choose Constitution as one of their two stats.

Your AC is equal to 10 + the average of your chosen two stats' mods + your wardrobe's tier, but no worries, the sheet automatically calculates this for you!

You then have accessories. These are trinkets, decorations, and other things that your character carries on them. Your character doesn’t start with any, but will gather them over time as they gain items through alchemy.

Strife specibi come in many shapes and varieties. Every specibus is marked with certain tags to help identify how they work (which we will quickly cover below). Each specibus has a number of unique abilitechs, which come in several varieties.

- Basic Abilitechs are fundamental to the given specibus: everyone knows how to use them. A basic abilitech’s name is listed in bold.
- Special Abilitechs are more specialized trick with a specibus; martials begin play with all of their special abilitechs known, but hybrids have to learn them and psions can't use them at all.
- Certain abilitechs aren't tied to a specibus. These typically come from Steps in PnP.

To use an abilitech with a specibus, expend the type of action listed (such as a major action or minor action). For an attack roll, you then roll a d20 and add your Proficiency (P) and the specibus’ associated Stat Modifier. If your attack hits, roll damage according to the listed damage for that attack.

Speaking of hands, a specibus may be held in either one or two hands when attacking, and will be marked according to how many hands are required.

But some weapons are versatile, meaning you are able to use it with one hand (damage values listed assume such), or switch to using both to increase the damage of your attacks by one die step.

There is also the occasional double weapon, which is a specibus that has two pieces held in each hand, which are generally used together for combo attacks. These require two hands to wield, but unlike a two-handed weapon it is possible to drop one half of a double weapon to free a hand and continue fighting, but you cannot combo (by itself; you can still combo if your other hand has a combo specibus or is free to use a combo subpower) or use any special abilitechs with only half of the specibus.

Specibi fall under one of three broad categories.

- **Melee Specibi** are primarily useful for up close and personal fights.
- **Ranged Specibi** will always use Dexterity (DEX), and are useful at a normal range (listed in the specibus itself), and a little less useful when extended to their maximum range (this is called their long range, not all ranged specibi have this) and adjacency (within 5 ft.). If making an attack at long range or adjacency, you roll at disadvantage to hit.

- **Thrown Specibi** are much like ranged specibi, only they do not suffer from disadvantage at certain ranges, and might be used with Strength (STR) instead. However, they tend towards a much shorter range.

- And **Special Specibi** are the snowflakes that do not fit well into the above two groups for one reason or another. It either mixes melee and ranged attacks to not fit into the melee or ranged categories, has a large abilitech list but some of the abilitechs provide support and utility than damage, or the specibus is another being in its own right!

And they can have certain tags about them.

- **Brutality** always utilizes your Strength (STR) modifier.
- **Finesse** allows you to choose between STR and Dexterity (DEX).
- **Esoteric** always utilizes whatever modifier is listed for it.
- **Reload** specibi requires ammunition (which you are considered to keep in ample supply, no worries!) and can hold a certain number of rounds/charges. You cannot use an abilitech that expends ammo if you do not have the ammo to spend; once all rounds have been expended, the specibus must be reloaded to continue attacking.
- **Combo** tagged abilitechs (or subpowers!) allow for combo attacks, allowing you to make a combo attack as a major action, then another as a minor action. This minor action attack's damage roll doesn't add any listed stat mods to damage. Combo attack abilitechs are italicised.
	- If you make two abilitech combo attacks, you make them with each hand, requiring you to have the appropriate weapon in each hand, with two halves of a double weapon in your hands, two copies of a one-handed specibus in your hands, or a two-handed specibus.
	- If you make two subpower combo attacks, you must do so with both hands free to use the power (or powers, if you roll that way). However, the damage from combo subpowers ignore the +1 die size for wielding a versatile power with both hands.
	- Yes, you can mix abilitech and subpower combo attacks together, just have a combo weapon in one hand and the other hand available to use the combo subpower.

- **Cache** tagged specibi also require ammunition to use most or all abilitechs, but these cannot be restored during strife once they are spent, instead replenished during a short rest (you are able to replenish your cache, you do not have to tediously scrounge for supplies).
- **Control** tagged specibi have a control radius in which the specibus can act (and do not act if taken out of this range); rideable specibi like bikes and controllable specibi like puppets fall into this category. They move on your turn as you will them, but cannot perform any other actions without you. You'll notice your abilitechs specify that your minion is the one doing them, but just as you would roll to hit with a sword or roll to grapple with a whip, you provide any rolls on your minion's behalf.
	- All control specibi count as minions while in use; more specifically, they count as allies while in use, for certain Steps and other abilities that might rely on this. However, this specibi also comes with its own hit points; if it is reduced to 0 HP, it is rendered unusable and requires a short rest to restore to full HP.

Phew! Did you catch all of that? Good! Remember, everyone (usually…) gets at least one! Your character begins play with one T0 weapon allocated to each specibus, the details of which are up to you to describe. If you need more than two spaces, or you have a psionic power that needs more room, you can unhide it on the left of the sheet!

## Skills and Proficiencies

Here, you decide which one Resistance you can add your Proficiency to, and what Skills your character is good at.

First, check the Resistance scores on the Mechanics tab on your sheet. Each is made from 10 plus the modifiers of two stats: STR and CON for Fortitude, DEX and INT for Reflex, and WIS and CHA for Will. Decide on one of the three you would like to give a boost; you could further buff your best resistance, or try to compensate for your weakest (psions and hybrids are coming in with a -4 to their Will, for example). Whatever your choice, mark it by using the dropdown to select the filled box.

Second, scroll down to the list of Skills on the same tab. You have 6 skill points at level one that you can distribute as you wish. You will notice that each skill has a maximum: the number of points you can put in a skill is limited by the stat mod associated with it. Pick any and all skills that appeal to what you think your character would be good at, or have practice with!

## Decors, Demeanor, and Specialization

Still with us? This is one of the last mechanical steps. Here, you decide what Decor, Demeanor, and Specialization you have.

Scroll down to Decors and Demeanor on the Character tab. A decor represents some particular activity your character is good at. Pick one that you think your character possesses. A demeanor represents something about your character and the way they approach problems. These translate to giving you additional dice to roll when making checks, improving your odds of success.

- Passion represents emotions, confrontation, and personal power.
- Artifice represents finesse, evasion, and control.
- Erudition represents calculation, knowledge, and exploiting opportunities.

Then you have a specialization at level one to pick. We recommend you go with All-Rounder for now— this choice of specialization represents something radical about your origin. Unless you have something very specific in mind that fits one of them, go with the default All-Rounder.

- Developer’s Note (3/10/20): You don’t get two specibi by default anymore, picking All-Rounder gives you the second one back. Alternately, if the lack never bothered you anyway, you can pick up some extra skill points.

## Miscellaneous

### Sylladex Types

There are a lot of sylladices in Homestuck, and we mean a lot. Just as sylladex shenanigans faded out as Homestuck went on, so do they disappear in RPGStuck. Still, it's one of the neater details you can flesh out about your character!

Each sylladex has two components you have to choose when putting it together, a captchalogue deck and a fetch modus. There are four types of captchalogue decks:

- **Default:** which lets you captchalogue items about as big as you.
- **Light:** which limits the size of items you can captchalogue, but you can eject them further.
- **Heavy:** which lets you captchalogue items bigger than you, but limits how far you can eject them.
- **Packrat:** which makes strifing with sylladex ejection untenable, but lets you pack more items into your modus and lets you captchalogue bigger items like the Heavy option. If you pick this, make sure to unhide the rows under the sylladex section to reveal the extra space.

For your fetch modus, you have to pick a skill; what skill is most associated with the fetch modus? You won't actually have to make a check with this skill whenever you want to take an item out. That said, you do use it in place of an attack roll when you eject something.
for ideas for fetch modus, go to [[RPGStuck/Miscellaneous/Fetch Modi\|Fetch Modi]]

## Details

Finally, now that we have the difficult stuff covered, let’s get to know the character you’ve just created! When building a character, feel free to personalize it! Go back and reskin choices you have made so far, to better reflect the unique personality of your weird apocalypse causing teenager. As a rule of thumb, we encourage players to change up whatever they like, so long as the numbers behind the flavor text remain!

- **Name:** Everyone has one, so should your character. Reminder that the standard for first and last name lengths is 4 and 6/7 for humans, and 6 and 6 for trolls. Most folks aren’t terribly strict on the human names.
- **Gender:** Are you a boy? Or a girl? ...Or something in between, look we’re not a poke-professor and don’t judge in binaries.
- **Handle:** Dig out your thesaurus and throw us your best pseudobabble terms to help vaguely portray your character in two words or less!
- **Dream Moon, Classpect, Land:** You won’t be filling this out juuuuust yet. You’ll learn what your character has as their session unfolds.
- **Quirk:** When designing a troll quirk, remember that whatever you select will be something you need to type in for quite a long time. And while humans don’t really do the quirk thing, this is a great time to consider their text color, and the cadence with which they type!
- **Guardian:** For trolls, this means a lusus. For humans, some adult relation of dubious origins who may or may not have picked your character out of a crater as a baby.
- **Hobbies:** Everyone has some, even if it’s playing tabletop RPGs online.
- **Personality Traits:** What are your characters ideals and beliefs? How do they behave?
- **Backstory:** A history of what makes your character tick, and why they became the person they are now.
- **Customization:** If you have custom Steps, or reskinned specibi or powers you want to use with the sheet, go to the Customization tab and put it in there!
- **Color:** Presentation counts for something, after all. At the top of the sheet, go to Format, then click Theme. Select the current Custom theme the sheet has, then you can adjust the colors of the theme. You can find what colors correspond to what parts of the sheet at the bottom of the Mechanics tab. Try it out! Just… don’t replicate Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, please.
