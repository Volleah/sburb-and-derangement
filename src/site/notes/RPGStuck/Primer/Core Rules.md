## Weaving the Story

A roleplaying game is a dialogue between the session master (SM) and the players, with dice rolls to adjudicate points of uncertainty, to tell a story. Let's look at what this dialogue looks like.

The SM describes the scene in which the player is in, presenting them with the options available to them, or an opening for responses. Then the player describes what they want to do and how, and the SM determines how that action(s) is resolved. Sometimes, the task is easy; it just happens, and the SM narrates the results. Other times, there's uncertainty about whether a given task succeeds; this is where dice are rolled, and the SM describes what happens based on their results.

The narration continues until the player reaches another decision point. In this way, the dialogue proceeds, telling the story of the session by weaving together strings of three elements: narration (SM), response (player), and resolutions (dice).

## Responsibilities

It is the session master's responsibility to keep their session running, just as it is the player's responsibility to play their character.

The SM sets the fiction, creates problems for the player characters to overcome, and makes judgment calls on how the rules apply to a situation.

The player creates and faithfully roleplays their character, overcomes the challenges in their way, and pushes their characters in interesting directions.

However, everyone in a session is responsible for ensuring everyone else is having fun. Make the other people in your group feel welcome, celebrate each others' successes, and collaborate to write a memorable story.

## A Character is You

Every character has six stats that act as the core of their strengths and weaknesses. Each stat comes with a stat modifier, acting as a measure of your character's capabilities wherever that stat can be applied.

Every character also has a Proficiency bonus, representing the gradual growth of many of the character's abilities over time, and skills. Each skill comes with skill points, representing their capabilities with tasks where that specific field of expertise can be brought to bear.

And lastly, every character has a name, backstory, and personality, to explain how to address them, how they came to be, and how they behave.

Of course, when one looks at the sheet, they will find there is far more to a character than just the above, but all of it relies on these core things.

## Dice Rolls

RPGStuck uses different sorts of dice (or dicebots), the d20 chief among them. The d20 is a twenty-sided funny-looking polyhedron made usually of plastic or metal, with the occasional die made of wood, ivory, or other exotic materials. Often, you will end up using a dicebot, which automatically rolls a number for you, using the power of technology to always give you, and only you, the worst rolls at the worst possible times.

The d20 is used in attack rolls and skill checks, the two main types of rolls by which uncertainty is resolved in this system. Whenever an uncertain action is taken, a roll is made and compared against some threshold: if the roll matches or beats this threshold, the roll is considered a success. The SM then determines what happens, based on the result.

#### Attack Roll

The attack roll is made when its namesake is attempted: a hammer swung at an Imp, firing a gun at an Ogre, psionic eye lasers at the Black King. An attack roll rolls a d20, then adds Proficiency, stat modifier, and any relevant bonuses/maluses. The result is compared against the target's relevant defense, which represents their ability to shrug off or avoid harm. The defenses are armor class, fortitude, reflex, and will, and are specific to the target.

#### Skill Check

The skill check is made when some challenging task is attempted: climbing a mountain, fixing a bike, finding Waldo. A skill check rolls a d20, then adds skill points, stat modifier, and relevant bonuses/maluses. The result is often compared to a difficulty class, or DC, a measure of the difficulty of the task.

#### Diceplay

There can be a variety of circumstances and forces at work that help or hinder your rolls. These are represented by various bonuses and maluses, or anything that modifies the roll that isn't Proficiency, skill points, or stat modifier. They either come as flat numbers (such as firing into cover, or aiming for their leg) or as additional dice (such as Aim, Block, Stakes, and Flaws dice).

There is also advantage and disadvantage, which represent fairly hefty circumstances and forces that work in your favor or against you. When rolling at advantage, you roll a second d20 and take the higher d20 roll. Similarly, when rolling at disadvantage, you roll a second d20 but take the lower d20 roll. The two cancel each other out; if you have both, you roll as if you had neither.

However, they can stack in certain situations: if you would have advantage from two or more sources and you have nothing that imposes disadvantage, you additionally take +4 to the roll or check. Similarly, if you must have disadvantage from two or more sources and you have nothing that gives advantage, you additionally take -4 to the roll. In either case, if you have both, they all cancel out and you roll as if you had neither, no matter how many instances of each you have.

#### Rounding

If you're ever dealing with dice and you end up with decimals, say you had to halve a roll, you typically round down, unless the reason that makes you have to round in the first place tells you to round up, then you round up.

## Encounters

Encounters come in two main types: just as there are attack rolls and skill checks, there are strifes and gambits. These represent more complex forms of resolving the outcome of some uncertain events, with each encounter broken down into rounds. In each round, each participant has a turn on which they take actions and roll dice; all turns happen in the same round, but each turn is played out in sequence to turn the chaos of an encounter into something manageable.

#### Strife

A strife begins when there is a fight to be had: a duel with a Basilisk, fighting through a horde of Imps, tag teaming the Black Queen with a friend.

In a strife, two or more sides exchange attack rolls against the other's defenses until one side concedes, flees, or falls.

Each turn, the player character has one major action, one minor action, and move actions up to 30 feet of movement total. They additionally have one reaction they can take at any point during a round. And of course, there are free actions for, among other things, talking.

A strife uses initiative rolls to determine who goes first in a round, damage rolls to determine how much harm a successful attack roll inflicts, and hit points to represent how much harm a given character can handle.

#### Gambit

A gambit begins when there is a hefty, challenging task to be accomplished: sneaking through a bank, debating someone on public television, solving an ancient puzzle in a lost temple.

In a gambit, the player makes skill checks against a DC, or both sides make competing skill checks against each other, to determine if the task is successfully accomplished, or not.

## Progression of Events

Every game of Sburb can be wildly different. After all, the games played in canon were special cases where exceptions and time shenanigans made it significantly different from how a normal game proceeds, and sessions in the community are no different.

However, there's common milestones that almost all sessions tend to hit:

- **Entry Process:** The first few acts of Homestuck, where the kids must actually get into the game world.
- **The Quest and the Seven Gates:** Every player has a Quest to see through, when they enter the game and arrive on their Land. Every Land has seven Gates, by which distant places may be visited, whether it be far-flung locales of their Land, or their fellow co-players' Lands.
- **Dreamselves and Dream Moons:** The dreamself that is active when their waking self is asleep, and every character has one (or two, if your name is Solluxander). These dreamselves slumber in towers on the dream moons of Prospit and Derse, separate worlds with their own cast of characters and conflicts.
- **The Denizen and the Choice:** The Denizen is the master of a Land, and each Denizen offers a Choice to the player, relating to their quest and their character.
- **Skaia:** The trolls fought the Black King as a final boss on Skaia. Jade had to bring it with her to another session to finish the creation process. In the end, Skaia is a driving force in the endgame of a session of Sburb, to use it as part of the Ultimate Alchemy to birth a new universe of the players' creation.

Beyond this simple framework, however, the game is yours, and in this respect, RPGStuck is no different than other tabletops: What story will your group tell?
