>[!quote] “Skill issue”

## Skill Checks

A skill check is a roll the player makes when they want to perform some simple action whose outcome is uncertain: you roll a d20, then add the skill's associated stat mod and skill points to the roll. If you are not in a strife, you might also have Stakes and Flaws This roll is then applied against a difficulty class, or DC.

If you beat the DC, you pass the skill check. If you don't, you fail the check and suffer some consequence; you are assumed to still perform that action, but modified by the consequence in question. The consequence may be as minor as incurring cuts and bruises as you do it, or major, like failing to do the action. (failure and partial failure are the most common consequences).

Alternatively, if there is an actively opposing force, an opposed skill check can be made, where instead of a DC, the player rolls to beat an opponent’s roll. Ties are won by the player.

####  Difficulty Class

Difficulty class describes, well, the difficulty of a given check.

- **DC 10:** Easy. Just about anyone has a decent shot, and skilled players will usually succeed. Incredibly skilled players will eventually auto-pass these.

- **DC 15:** Medium. A skilled player will find this about average. An unskilled player will find it a challenge. This is the average difficulty.

- **DC 20:** Hard. Even skilled players will find this a challenge, and the most skilled are still not guaranteed success.

- **DC 25:** Extreme. Skilled players must fall back on assistance, or bring supernatural powers to bear, to have any hope in succeeding. The incredibly skilled only have a decent shot at best.

#### Stakes and Flaws

Stakes and Flaws dice are d6s that can further modify a skill check. They represent a wide variety of tools, talents, circumstances, approaches, and the like that increases (Stakes) or decreases (Flaws) your odds of success.

Whenever making a skill check outside of a strife, roll up all Stakes dice, or all Flaws dice, and take the highest die. If you rolled Stakes dice, add the die to the check. If you rolled Flaws dice, subtract the die from the check. If you have both, remove one of each until you only have one kind of dice left (or none!).

Commonly, you can get Stakes dice from Decors, which reward you for utilizing your skills in a particular manner.

Roleplay and alchemy are the other common methods; in general, you receive one Stakes die for something that helps you in some way. Two dice if it was incredibly helpful. More specific examples can be found in the later sections of this chapter.

#### List of Skills

Players have the following skills:

>[!info] **Athletics (Strength)** 
>describes your training in arduous physical activities, such as climbing a rocky cliff, quickly ascending a steep slope, and so on, and is used in grappling.

>describes your health, your ability to stave off ill effects and push yourself beyond normal physical limits, whether it be for the moment or over longer streaks, such as resisting the urge to throw up, shrugging off some debilitating effect, pushing onwards through harsh weather, or holding your breath for long periods of time. Just as Sanity describes mental resilience, Endurance describes physical resilience.

>[!info] Acrobatics (Dexterity)
>describes your deft body movement capability, and covers attempts to stay on one’s feet, as well as maneuvers that require agility more than strength. It includes activities like escaping a grapple, performing flips and dives, and keeping one’s balance.

>describes your fine finger control and your ability to perform small actions without others noticing, such as switching two player cards, pickpocketing someone, or hiding a dagger up your sleeve.

>[!info] Stealth (Dexterity)
>describes your ability to conceal yourself and pass by unnoticed.

>[!info] Engineering (Intelligence) 
>encompasses technological background and efficacy in building, constructing, and working with technological devices. This could be synthesizing chemicals, rewiring an electronic alarm, programming a computer, building a complex rope and pulley system, or designing an architectural structure.

>[!info] Investigation (Intelligence) 
>describes how well you are able to piece together clues, make inferences, and logically deduce things. Investigation checks could be made to figure out how to disarm a trap mechanism, infer that public dormitory style housing could mean a fairly regimented society, and so on.

- Medicine (Wisdom) describes your ability to diagnose and effectively treat wounds. It also describes your grasp of the underlying knowledge behind the biology and chemistry of the body, as well tangential knowledge, from epidemiology, to diets and poisons, to weaknesses in the human body.
- Perception (Wisdom) describes your awareness of your surroundings. This encompasses things such as noticing hidden creatures or objects, finding traps, or eavesdropping.
- Sanity (Wisdom) describes your mental fortitude and ability to resist harmful influences and retain your sense of self in the midst of traumatic circumstances. Just as Endurance describes physical resilience, sanity describes mental resilience.
- Survival (Wisdom) describes your ability to survive in the wild, including finding safe food, navigation, making effective shelters, tracking creatures, avoiding natural hazards, and predicting weather.

- Deception (Charisma) describes your ability to convince others a falsehood is true. This could be outright lying, feinting in combat, visually disguising yourself, or mimicking another creature.

- Persuasion (Charisma) describes your ability to influence people in good faith without deception. This includes using logical arguments to convince someone, etiquette to help someone be more friendly to you, or make cordial requests. It may also be used for small talk, schmoozing, or flirting.

##### Gambits and Challenges

A gambit is a type of encounter where you attempt to perform/achieve some complex or significant task/goal where a single check won't cut it. The keywords are complexity and gravity; a task must have one or both of these to be worth a gambit.

In a gambit, you roll up to three skill checks, against a DC that correlates to the difficulty of the task at hand. If a check beats the DC by higher numbers, you can get more than one success. You get EXP for passing a gambit. This EXP is determined by the player's tier and the gambit's DC.

For every 5 over the DC, the check counts as an additional success. However, for every 5 under the DC, the check instead removes a success. This can bottom out to give you negative successes, if the dicebot really hates you. You do not suffer consequences for a failed check in a gambit; any consequences are handed out after all the checks are made.

Between each check, the narrative continues. Your action takes effect, and the encounter evolves accordingly, before rolling the next check.

Once all the checks are made (or you accrue five successes), resolve the gambit. If you have five successes, you fully pass the gambit and do what you set out to do. If you don't, you suffer a consequence, its severity growing with how many successes you were short, down to total failure if you have no successes. If you somehow have negative successes at the end of the gambit, you take another consequence on top.

You're allowed to push a gambit by going for a fourth check. However, you roll this check at disadvantage, and you must abide by its results. Pushing a gambit is a desperation move.

Gambits, In-Depth

- Developer's Note (1/17/21): While this section was not written by a member of the development team responsible for writing up documents, it has nonetheless proven helpful enough in its current state to merit being put into the Primer.

WHAT ARE GAMBITS?  

>A Gambit is called when there is a difficult task ahead not immediately accomplished by combat. sneaking through areas, debating, puzzling and chase scenes are some examples of Gambits.

>Gambits can happen DURING combat, Gambit actions are FREE actions. and don’t interfere with the mechanical aspects of combat.  

>Gambits use an unique resource to measure success, (similar yet separate to HP in  combat) called a Gambit BAR. there are 2 types of Gambits.

  
REGULAR GAMBIT  
  
![](/img/user/Attachments/image9.png)  

>The Gambit bar starts full at the beginning of the GAMBIT ENCOUNTER  
>It’s considered the opponent’s decor bar  
>The Gambit bar has 5 pips by default.  
>It can go BEYOND 5 pips.  
  
The goal of a regular Gambit is for the player to completely deplete this bar through their usage of skills (Gambit CHECKS)  

OPPOSED GAMBIT  
![](/img/user/Attachments/image5.png)  
  
>opposed Gambits contain 2 bars, one for the player, and one for the opponent  
>Each bar has either 5 pips, or the highest skill mod of each participant (only the highest counts.)  
>Both Gambit bars start at full  
>DM decides who starts (coinflip for fairness?)  

The goal of an opposed Gambit is to reduce your opponent’s Gambit bar to ZERO, while maintaining yours above that.

HOW TO USE GAMBITS?

Gambits are primarily Roleplay governed by a set of STAKES and FLAWS that grant mechanical bonus or malus to your Gambit check in the form of D6s

![](/img/user/Attachments/image6.png)

Stakes are bonuses, they represent your specific talents, the opponent’s weakness and available tools, as well as the circumstances surrounding the current Gambit.  
  
Decors, backstory and more will increase your chances of success.

Flaws are negative and they can be your character’s specific weaknesses, an opponent’s particular strength or lack of proper resources to act at full potential, as well as the circumstances surrounding the Gambit  
They can reduce your chances of success.![](/img/user/Attachments/image3.png)

  

The number of dice for stakes and flaws increase with the complexity and strength of each particular benefit or frailty.  
  
IT SHOULD BE NOTED, THAT THE PRIMARY FORM TO ACQUIRE STAKES DICE IS THROUGH DECOR.

THE GAMBIT CHECK:                  A Gambit check works similarly to a skill check, whoever, when making a Gambit roll, the player rolls all of their Gambit dice, and adds (or subtracts) the result of the highest scoring  dice to their check as such.  
  
1d20+(skill the player wants to use for the Gambit)+Gambit dice  
![](/img/user/Attachments/image2.png)

If a player has both stakes and flaws available, one of each must be removed until only 1 Gambit dice (or none) remain  
  
as seen on the left, the player had only 2 stakes, and three flaws. so two stakes cancel 2 flaws, and 1 flaw remains.  
  
  
  

GAMBIT RESOLUTION:  
  
For regular Gambits, we check if the player’s Gambit check beat the DC for the situation, if the player succeeds, they subtract 1 pip from the Gambit barFor every 5 points over the DC, the player subtracts an additional pip (see image)  
  
For every 5 points under the DC, the Gambit bar heals 1 pip, with overhealing being possible here.  
  
Once damage // Healing has been dealt, a new round for the Gambit starts.  
  
The DCs are as follows:![](/img/user/Attachments/image1.png)

Easy (DC 10)

Medium (DC 15)

Hard (DC 20)

Extreme (DC 25)

for opposing Gambits, the player to start the round goes for their Gambit check, and regardless of the result, adds 1 damage to the DAMAGE POOL.  
  
the opponent, then counters by beating the opponent’s Gambit check (setting the new bar) and adding one damage to the pool  
  
...or concedes, taking the damage and not adding to this pool  
  
This back and forth continues until either participant fails/concedes and takes damage, and from there, a new round is started.  
  
  
ADDITIONAL NOTES:![](/img/user/Attachments/image7.png)

  
Gambits can end when:  
The player decides to end it (or both participants on an opposed) or when the Gambit bar reaches ZERO.  
  
while combat turns take up to 6 seconds, Gambit rounds have no time restriction and can be performed in a long term fashion depending on the actions carried out  
GAMBITS ARE TIRING, AFTER 3 ROUNDS HAVE ELAPSED, PARTICIPANTS GAIN DISADVANTAGE TO THEIR CHECKS (round 4). IT ENDS AFTER THE FOURTH ROUND NO MATTER WHAT.  
  
An empty Gambit bar means a complete success  
  
A partially empty bar indicates moderate success or small complications.  
  
A completely full bar indicates that the situation hasn’t managed to either get better or worse.  
  
An overflowing bar indicates the player has made their current situation worse.                                       ![](/img/user/Attachments/image4.png)

Opposed Gambits

If there is an active, opposing force, it is an opposed gambit instead. In this, you roll off against an opponent in three rounds of checks instead, trying to get five successes before they do.

In each round, one side makes a skill check, called the opening. Then the other side has the choice of conceding the round, or upping the ante with a counter and making a skill check back. If a counter beats its preceding check, it goes back to the other side to concede or counter, like a hot potato.

When one side fails to beat the check, or concedes, the other side accrues as many successes as checks were made during that round. Then the side that lost begins the next round.

- Developer's Note (6/17/20): In this way, opposed gambits are like a game of poker, you either fold or raise. You're not allowed to call, you either raise the Stakes or you quit.

You can push an opposed gambit for a fourth round, but all checks in the round are made at disadvantage. So can the other side, if they wish.

When all the rounds are played (or one side accrues five successes), resolve the gambit. If you have five successes, you win, and do what you set out to do. If your opponent got five successes, you fail and take a consequence on top.

If neither side got all five, compare them. If you have more than your opponent, you suffer a consequence (but not failure) as you achieve your goal. If your opponent has more than you, you fail to do it. If there is a tie, the two of you immediately make an opposed skill check as a tiebreaker, with the winner getting a success. Then resolve accordingly.

Other Gambits

If there is a fixed number of tasks to be done, an overclock gambit may be used. In this, you make a fixed number of rolls, typically three to six, then tally up your successes at the end. If you have ten or more successes (you had enough to fill the gambit clock twice over), you not only succeed the gambit, but gain an additional benefit.

If the gambit's goal is to forestall disaster, a catastrophe gambit might be used. In this, the gambit gains a success every time the player fails to meet an objective; if the gambit is ever successful, a catastrophe occurs and the forestalled disaster comes into play.

Examples of such can be found in the SMA, as these types no longer strictly key to EXP gain.

Challenges

A gambit's checks can compensate for or undo each other. This works in social and stealth challenges, where a misstep can unravel your work, or a lucky break can redeem it.

But not all tasks work this way, where your performance in one thing you do can retroactively rewrite the progress of another.

If you have to sail the seas, climb a cliff, unlock the gates, and charm the angry monks to obtain a hidden treasure, failing to unlock the gates doesn't undo the progress you made by sailing and climbing. Furthermore, each of these things would probably be their own skill checks.

This is called a challenge, where you complete several checks in succession until you achieve your goal. You get EXP for completing a challenge. The EXP is determined by the player's tier and the average DC of the challenge's checks.

Example of Play

Let's look at an example. The player is a troll looking to drive an arms dealer out of town for selling faulty ammo. The DC is 10, and it's going to be a regular gambit.

The troll grills the dealer about their wares and curious misfires, before pointing a gunblade in their face. This will be one Stakes die. They make a skill check and get 18. They roll their d6 Stakes die and get a 6. So their total is 24.

This is 14 above the DC of 10. They get three successes. If the player had gotten 25, that'd be 15 over the DC, for four successes.

The dealer tries making excuses, and accidentally insults the troll. They respond by pulling the trigger as a bluff, using one of the same faulty rounds the dealer sold them. This was deemed badass enough for two Stakes dice. They make another skill check and get 13. They roll their two Stakes dice and take the highest. 2 and 5, so they take the 5. Their total is 18.

This is 8 above the DC. They gain an additional two successes, which brings them to the five they need to pass the gambit. The dealer trips over themselves throwing back the money, a bit more on top, and promptly flees the town, leaving the troll with XP and the dealer's money.

##### Consequences

We'll be going over this briefly and giving examples in later sections of this chapter to give you an idea, while detailed discussions of consequences can be found in the SMA.

- Developer's Note (7/14/20): Or rather, will be. The Session Master's Assistant is always undergoing reconstruction. Such is the life of a playtest.

Consequences are something that impedes you or sets you back in some way, or is directly failure; the check or gambit was unsuccessful. This can include harm, resource, price, and surprise.

- Harm is straightforward, it is bodily harm, injury to body or mind, hit point damage. If you jump and fail to stick the landing, you're going to be hurt.

- Resource involves what you have used. Something you spent took more than you expected. You spent time looking for your wedding ring, but it took you far longer than you would've liked.

- Price asks you to spend something you did not already use, or suffer a worse consequence. If you fail to appease the spirits, you'll have to spend a lesser slot to banish them, or a revenant will cross over and hurt you.

- Surprise represents results that you did not anticipate. You infiltrated a private party despite failing the check, but you were quickly trapped in boring conversation with a foul-odored consort.

Failure is what it sounds like, you don't succeed at the task for which you made the skill check.

- Partial failure is also what it sounds like. You tried to persuade a merchant to give you the quest macguffin for free, but they will only give you a discount.

But let's go deeper. What happens because they fail?

- You lose control of the situation, and it becomes more difficult to proceed. You failed to pick the lock, now it's jammed into the wrong position and unlocking it will be harder to do.

- Roadblock bars the way between you and your goal, a new obstacle to be resolved before you can continue. You failed to sneak out of the house, you must deal with your parents before you can try again.

- You lose the opportunity, and the situation evolves such that you cannot try it again. You must find a new approach. You only got a sneer, a rude gesture, and a lifetime ban from the jewelry shop with the quest macguffin you need, now you may need to use the five finger discount.

Failing Forward

Shutting a player out without an alternative option is a surefire way to kill any momentum they had. Players will inevitably fail their checks if RNG has anything to say about it, they will suffer the consequences of their failures eventually. The narrative should not depend on the player passing their checks in order to progress.

Consequences are presented in RPGStuck in such a way that there can always be another way forward, despite their bad luck. Failing a check can be more interesting than passing it, depending on the SM's creativity.

The SM should be a fan of the players. This isn't to say that everything should be handed to them on a silver platter, but there should be a way forward that the players can easily grasp, in their threads and in the session as a whole.

##### The Social Network

Social interaction is one of the fundamental pillars of roleplaying. And indeed civilized life itself, but this is a tabletop game, you're here to read about social skill checks and gambits where social encounters are concerned.

As even a casual reader of Homestuck will be aware (if such a thing exists), conversations and speeches and other words for gabbing away with words beige and purple form a massive part of Sburb, and the same is true in RPGStuck.

Social Checks

A check is used when there is uncertainty about the outcome of an action. A social check, therefore, is used when there's uncertainty about the outcome of a social interaction, how the other side will react in response to something you said.

The typical skills used in a social check is the triad of Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion. These are different approaches, whether you lie, bully, or charm to get your way. Performance is also a way to sway others. Occasionally, the SM may decide actions speak louder than words and let you check some other skill; this is uncommon and is purely at SM discretion.

On the other side, Insight is used to discern someone's intentions. If you try to deceive someone, and they are actively anticipating it, this would see an opposed check, Deception versus Insight, to see if the target of your deception falls for it. You might also do this if you suspect the NPC is lying to you and want to get a read on them.

Insight is not used to resist, say, Persuasion. Insight gives you, well, an insight, into someone's words and actions. It has no bearing on changing someone's mind by itself. In that vein, the SM does not make checks for NPCs to interact with you, the player. You have autonomy in this regard, where your character cannot be made to believe something solely because the dice said so, you must do it of your own volition.

Examples

Let's look over some samples to get a feel for this. Your mileage may vary, depending on your SM and the way they like to run their sessions.

- Example Checks:

- Regular: Ask a consort to do you a favor, scaring a child into brushing their teeth.
- Opposed: Convince a cop your story is valid and that carapacian's is not, explain to your mother the magazines are not what it looks like.

- Example Gambits:

- Regular: Persuade a horrorterror to grant you a boon, intimidate an arms dealer into refunding and fleeing town, play the lead role in a stage performance.
- Opposed: Compete on Alternia's Got Talent, debate the merits of monarchism in front of a crowd.

- Example DCs:

- DC 10: Convincing a child to go to somewhere they don’t want to, or lying to said child that you did not eat their snacks when you totally did.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +0, for opposed checks.

- DC 15: Lying to a detective, or performing for snooty art critics. Convincing an underling to leave you alone.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +5, for opposed checks.

- DC 20: Convincing a cop to let you out of a misdemeanor, instilling fear into a jaded warrior, or convincing an underling to do you a favor.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +10, for opposed checks.

- DC 25: The DC 20 situations, but noticeably more severe. Say, convincing an irate denizen to do you a favor.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +15, for opposed checks.

- Example Stakes and Flaws:

- 1 Stakes Die: Chocolates and flowers, promises of wealth or power, a budding reputation. A gift. Playing to one's traits. A favorable air.
- 2 Stakes Dice: Blackmail, a gunblade in their face. Something with gravity, or urgency.
- 1 Flaws Die: Social stigma, a rotten stench, pronouncing GIF incorrectly. An unfavorable air. Something that invites scorn. A social faux pas.
- 2 Flaws Dice: Misanthropic personality, vicious rumors about you, an order from above. Intractable disposition. A severely unfavorable air. An outside influence.

Tie-Ins

Decors are often the go-to for Stakes dice. More specifically, the Persona and Direction groups.

Snooping around for some sort of hook on an NPC could serve as leverage. Witty repartee might impress them. Enlisting another NPC's aid is another. Social gambits are the most common, and fittingly, there is no end to the ways one might get Stakes. Or Flaws.

Alchemy geared towards social encounters typically boils down to information gathering. A way to read someone's mood, or glean surface thoughts akin to psionics. A device that reads personality traits and provides psych profiles.

Speaking of which, psionics, especially Dominating and Empathic Mind Controls, can greatly expand the dimensions for a social gambit, when one might be required at all. Remember, gambits are to resolve uncertainty: brief bouts of total mind control might bypass this, depending on the context.

##### The Sneaky Beaky

Stealth is something just about everyone understands: don't get caught! To expound on that, it's about acting without drawing attention, moving beneath notice. An alternate way to go about this is obfuscation; if you can't hide what you're doing, mislead any onlookers as to your actual intent and goals.

Even the most casual player will wonder if they can steal that slice of cake, or the magic item in the shop, or the queen's secret magazines, without getting caught. Secrecy and misdirection are the bread and butter of the stealth game.

Stealth Checks

A check is used when there is uncertainty about the outcome of an action. A stealth check, therefore, is used when there's uncertainty about the outcome of a trick, or a subversion, whether the other side will be fooled by your misdirection.

The typical skill used in a stealth check is, well, Stealth, with Perception used to oppose it. Occasionally, Survival might be substituted where camouflage and blending into one's surroundings matters, and Investigation might be used in certain contexts, but both of these skill substitutions are rare.

There is also Sleight of Hand, which goes together with stealth in the age-old tradition of picking people's pockets. Social skills also go hand in hand where misdirection by silvered words and subtle hands intertwine.

There is also attack rolls, which are technically not a skill check, but might be used as part of a stealth gambit if it involves taking out enemies from stealth.

To Surpass Metal Gear

Or Assassin's Creed, since those two come to mind first.

There are situations where the player may be faced with multiple opponents, guards, etc, with the option/intent to methodically take them out while avoiding detection. In these cases, instead of possibly running a strife for every set of guards, consider a stealth gambit to abstract the affair.

A popular depiction of stealth gameplay in videogames is that the player sneaks up to an unaware enemy and can knock them out or kill them in a single hit. Replicating this purely through strifes becomes very tedious, very quickly, depending on how many guards are around and what the map looks like, if one exists.

As a rule of thumb, consider which is more important; sneaking around, or the actual fight itself? If being a sneaky beaky matters more, use a gambit to abstract the player's progress, with every success representing the player taking out more and more guards, or how likely they are to get away scot-free.

Examples

Let's look over some samples to get a feel for this. Your mileage may vary, depending on your SM and the way they like to run their sessions.

- Example Checks:

- Regular: Run by a hall monitor when they're not looking, blend into the crowd when the mean girls posse is around.
- Opposed: Sneak by the neighbor's dog looking for someone to bark at, hide in the forest from an actual cannibal looking for you.

- Example Gambits:

- Regular: Stealthily take out a group of guards one by one without raising the alarm, locate and neutralize a VIP without being caught.
- Opposed: Evade armed guards searching for you after your prison break, sneak a long message to a third party while being watched.

- Example DCs:

- DC 10: Sneaking through an abandoned warehouse or dense forest, hiding in a concert or rave.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +0, for opposed checks.

- DC 15: Hiding from motivated guards under the city catacombs, searching for a specific tool whose only distinguishing feature is a small strip of colored tape.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +5, for opposed checks.

- DC 20: Evading bloodhounds and trained paramilitary forces, looking for that one specific lego piece in a man-sized pile of lego pieces.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +10, for opposed checks.

- DC 25: Hiding from every major government of the world, finding Waldo, pointing out the fourth wall.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +15, for opposed checks.

- Example Stakes and Flaws:

- 1 Stakes Die: Soundless sneakers, a brief distraction. A helpful item. An opportunity.
- 2 Stakes Dice: Certified ninja attire, a fireworks festival. A very helpful item. An environmental factor.
- 1 Flaws Die: Crunchy boots, loose tic tacs in your pocket, you don't actually know where the end is. An unhelpful item. A reason to meander.
- 2 Flaws Dice: Bells on the wrists and ankles, a phone not on vibrate, going it blind. A very unhelpful item. An unknown quantity.

Tie-Ins

Decors are often the go-to for Stakes dice. Every type of Decor has one or two suited towards this end.

The majority of Flaws will come from either inferior equipment, environmental factors, or unknowns. Accordingly, preparation can be as simple as scouting out the goal beforehand, getting rid of that rattling thing in your back pocket, and not going on a stealth mission in broad daylight.

Alchemy geared towards stealth encounters is focused on boosting one's stealth capabilities, as well as information gathering. Most Stakes dice will come from this or Decors. Clothes that absorb noise instead of generating it, a shiny distraction rock that always returns to your pocket, an accessory that briefly lets you become invisible.

##### The Mystic Paths

The existence of the supernatural is apparent in many ways: aliens, psionic powers, strange mystical powersets granted by a horribly designed game with an insistence for naming conventions.

If you are psionic, human or troll, you have access to new avenues of action in RPGStuck right off the bat. Assumptions are made about where your psionic powers came from, and what they can do. And eventually, all players will come to learn and wield the powers granted by their mythological role.

We'll be talking mainly about psionics here. In practice, it tends to be interchangeable with magic, and almost all of the advice for psionics also applies to classpects.

Supernatural Checks

A check is used when there is uncertainty about the outcome of an action. A supernatural check check, therefore, is used when there's uncertainty about the outcome of a supernatural action. Unlike social or stealth checks, it's not strictly about how the other side reacts, but a measure of the player's efforts.

The typical skill used in a supernatural check is your psionic skill, whether it be Occult, Sanity, Performance, or Athletics, depending on how your psionics manifest. We mention psionics first because you will have access to it right off the bat, whereas your classpect abilities will take longer to manifest.

The other side will often respond in kind. Caster-type opponents in RPGStuck tend to be high in Intelligence for Occult or Wisdom for Sanity. Sometimes, Endurance can come into play to resist, or Sanity if used in its capacity as a mental counterpart to Endurance.

The psionic skill may substitute for other skills in appropriate contexts. If you were searching for someone, you might use Perception, or Persuasion to sway someone. In both of those cases, you could justify using your psionic powers to achieve the same ends, but with Occult.

For SMs, know when to let the supernatural substitute for the mundane by the context of their powers. Telekines might justify using Occult in place of Acrobatics by using Lift to maneuver themselves, while Whisperers might switch out Persuasion for it when dealing with the undead.  Trying to jury rig a power for something other than its intended purpose falls into this category as well. It should be appropriately difficult for, say, an Electrokine to restart someone's heart.

A Word about Space

No, not the aspect.

In a social encounter, you have as many ways to approach your goal as there are ways to string together words, and the encounter evolves as the conversation does.

In a stealth encounter, you have as many ways to approach your goal as there are avenues of approach, and the encounter evolves as you move to new areas with new obstacles.

In a supernatural encounter, you have as many ways to approach your goal as there are methods or rites or processes to get the result you want. But how does this encounter evolve? And how do you react to it?

It'll require some explanation on how your psionic powers work, exactly. To be fairly general, and to link it to something else already in the system, let's say there exist three ways to go about leveraging your psionic power. You can do it with power, control, or knowledge, where the manner in which you wield your power matters.

You might notice this corresponds with Passion, Artifice, and Erudition, from Decors and Demeanors. ...or does it correspond with Slayer, Sentinel, and Strategist, from Pillars and Paths?

Examples

Let's look over some samples to get a feel for this. Your mileage will most certainly, depending on your SM, the way they like to run their sessions, and how their session treats psionics.

- Example Checks:

- Regular: Burn through a metal door as a Pyrokine, search for the source of a psychic phenomenon as an Antipsion.
- Opposed: Resist a mind reading, resist a corrupting influence.

- Example Gambits:

- Regular: Commune with the spirits of the dead.
- Opposed: Hold a mind knife fight with a psion, bind a horrorterror to your will.

- Example DCs:

- DC 10: Reading a dimwit's mind, juicing up an electric car, tracking the direction of a psionic disturbance.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +0, for opposed checks.

- DC 15: Creating a scale model of Istanbul with cryokinesis, compelling a ghost to speak with you, scanning a room for a specific individual.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +5, for opposed checks.

- DC 20: Interpreting an omen from a nightmare, compelling a spirit to do a simple task for you.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +10, for opposed checks.

- DC 25: Outwitting an all-knowing horrorterror, stacking a troll-sized house of cards with only one's mind, restarting a stopped heart with electrokinesis.

- Alternately, a total bonus of +15, for opposed checks.

- Example Stakes and Flaws:

- 1 Stakes Die: A psionic focus, the proper preparation, psi in the air. An implement. An adherence to the norm. A mystic influence.
- 2 Stakes Dice: Lesser slots, a celestial alignment, a blood sacrifice, an ancient focus, a six hour rite preceding it. Something scarce. An investment of self, or time.
- 1 Flaws Die: A tainted focus, the wrong rites, psi in the air. Mistaken tools, or rites. A mystic influence.
- 2 Flaws Dice: An ancient curse, anti-psionic interference. A greater, hostile power. Targeted interference.

Tie-Ins

There are a few Decors for supernatural Stakes dice, but they won't be your main way of getting them.

Spending psionic slots is an easy, albeit costly, way to get more Stakes dice. Maybe your SM will allow you to push yourself instead, giving up hit points instead.

Alchemy geared towards supernatural encounters typically either expands what you can do with your psionic potential, or enhances it. For a Telekine, for example. A bracelet synced to a sword they can wield proficiently purely through their mind. A focus that lets them create solid barriers that bar passage. A ring that boosts the range they can throw objects.

You'll notice this is specific to the Telekinesis power. Each power has its own ways it can diverge from others, such that no two players' movesets will be alike, despite having the same power.

##### The Peanut Gallery

Pursuing a fleeing target. Researching and writing a term paper. Exploring a hundred mile swathe of jungle. Casing a military base. Treating third degree burns. Building IKEA furniture. All these things don't quite fit into the previous three, but you may find yourself doing one or more of these at some point. These would obviously be done with checks and gambits. If you need to mix these as part of a greater goal, it's probably a challenge.

Let's go over this very broadly.

A check is used when there is uncertainty about the outcome of an action, or a gambit if the action is complex and/or significant.

If you're chasing someone, or athletically competing against another, you would use Athletics, or maybe Acrobatics, against the same. A game of football, wrestling, competitive tag. Opposed checks and gambits are common here.

Research, exploration, and investigation are all methods of information gathering at their core. Occult, Survival, and Investigation come to mind, but others might be fit in, depending on the situation. Checks and gambits aren't really opposed, given their solitary natures; there isn't really a way to oppose these in the context of opposed rolls.

Medicine and crafting use Medicine and often Engineering, though the latter could be substituted with Occult, depending on the context. For the same reasons as the information gathering above, these too tend not to have opposed checks or gambits.

This is not to say these are the only other ways skills could be used, but these are the most common. This is Sburb, unique cases are everywhere.

Stakes dice from roleplay and context is difficult to say without giving a three page list. Remember from the start of the chapter that in general, you receive one Stakes die for something that helps you in some way. Two dice if it was incredibly helpful. Consider this in terms of effect, time, and scale. If something lets them do it with increased effect, decreased time taken, or lets them do more of it, for example.

For alchemy, consider three questions: "Can I use this to do something I couldn't do before?", "Can I already do something, but this lets me do it better?", and "Can I already do something, but this lets me do it more easily?". Good alchemy says "Yes!" to at least one of these questions.
