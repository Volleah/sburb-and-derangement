## Overview

Strife in RPGstuck is broken up into rounds. Each round is 6 seconds of time. Rounds are broken up into turns, and each combatant typically has one turn per round, only acting on their turn. All turns “happen” in the same six-second round, but turn sequences exist as a necessary mechanic to adjudicate the chaos of battle into something playable.

Turns go in initiative order; at the start of a strife, all combatants make an initiative roll. This is typically 1d20+DEX, but a few abilities and effects can modify this. Turns play out from highest initiative, descending down. If there is a tie, compare the Dexterity stats of the tied creatures. If they’re still tied, flip a coin.

If some combatants aren’t aware of each other, the first round is a surprise round for those creatures; they don’t take turns in this round. Surprise rounds typically occur when one side is hidden, obfuscated, or otherwise unknown to the other such that they can ambush them. Then everything plays out as normal thereafter.

## Your Turn

You have a collection of actions on each turn.

Some enemies may have Rapid and/or Scripted actions. But these are rare and can be left for later.

When an ability mentions a turn, it generally means your turn in a given round than anyone's turn, unless specified otherwise.

## Major Actions

These tend to be the crux of your turn. You only get one per round, use it wisely.

- **Attack:** Attack a target. You roll 1d20 + relevant stat mod + Proficiency bonus. You have to roll the target’s relevant defense score or higher.
	- Attacks can be melee or ranged.
	- Melee’s default range of 5 feet unless stated otherwise.
	- Ranged can have two ranges, eg (80/150). First is normal range, second is max range. Attacks beyond normal range but within max range, or attacks within 5 feet, are made at disadvantage. Attacks can’t be made beyond max range.
	- Attacks can be weapon attacks or psionic attacks.
		- Weapon attacks deal physical damage and are usually made with a strife specibus.
		- Psionic attacks deal psionic damage and are usually made with a psionic power.
	- Not all attacks specify a type. For example, Fraymotifs and certain abilities in Pillars and Paths specify an attack roll, even though no damaging attack is made. In these cases, any effects that benefit attack rolls in general apply to them, but effects that specify a particular type of attack do not.
	- If a damaging attack doesn't specify a type and isn't only an abilitech or only a subpower, it may count as either one.
	- As a rule of thumb, if you can’t see your target, you have disadvantage to hit them.
	- Some attacks may not have any typings. However, attacks add Proficiency bonuses unless stated otherwise, such as weapons for which you do not possess the appropriate specibus.
	- True damage ignores all damage reductions but not damage immunity.
	- Unarmed Attack: Attack with your fists. Needs one free hand, uses Strength to hit, and deals 1+STR physical damage (min 1). These are considered to have the Combo property for the purposes of Combo Attacks (see Minor Actions).
	- Abilitech: Use a specibus abilitech. Abilitechs are found on strife specibi, and are typically just attacks as described in Attacks above.
	- Psionic Ability: Use a psionic power. Specify the subpower/ability and slot used (if any), then follow the effects as stated. If the psi is an attack, consult the Attack action.
	- Typically, you need line of sight to the target or the area affected by the target.
	- You cannot benefit from multiple copies of the same psionic ability unless the ability specifies otherwise.

- **Grappling:** Grapple a creature. You need at least one free hand. Attempt to seize the target by making an opposed check, your Athletics against their Athletics or Acrobatics (their choice). If you succeed, you grapple the target. Default range is 5 feet.
	- Your speed is halved while dragging or carrying a grappled creature.
	- A grappled creature can make an opposed check as a major action, their Athletics or Acrobatics (their choice) against your Athletics, to escape.
	- Check the [grappling section](#id.hg0oe7qw50mu) and the Grappled condition for more specifics.

- **Shove:** Push a creature no more than one size category larger than you, typically Large. Make an opposed check, your Athletics against their Athletics or Acrobatics (their choice). If you succeed, you push them 5 feet, plus 5 feet per 5 by which you beat their check. Alternately, you can choose to knock them Prone.
	- When Shoving a creature you are Grappling, you push them an additional 5 feet, for an initial 10 feet pushed. Typically, this will also push them out of the grapple.
	- Abilitechs and certain Steps can augment this even further.
	- Abilities: There are plenty of Steps, Fraymotifs, classpect abilities, and others that may require a major action.
	- Unless specified otherwise, an attack roll that specifies which stat (or gives you a range of stats to use) to use also adds your Proficiency to the roll.
	- You cannot benefit from multiple copies of the same ability unless the ability specifies otherwise.

- **Sylladex Ejection:** You eject the full contents of your sylladex, making an attack roll, but instead of a stat mod and Proficiency, add the chosen skill bonus, for every item launched against all targets within 30 feet, using the attack profile below.
	- 30 ft. range, single-target, ranged weapon attack, 1d4 damage, launches one item.
	- You cannot attack a given target more than three times. Any items launched in excess of available targets will still be launched, potentially causing catastrophic collateral damage to your surroundings and any allies. Critical fails to hit will also cause damage to your surroundings, but also to the item itself. The SM may give the attacks additional effects, based on the items launched at their discretion.
	- Sylladex ejection counts as a thrown weapon abilitech for the purposes of synergy with Pillars and Paths, alchemy, etc.

- **Minor Action:** You can downgrade your major action into another minor action.

- **Dash:** Double your remaining speed this turn.

- **Defend:** You focus on defending against incoming attacks. All attacks against you have disadvantage for 1 round.

- **Help:** You assist another creature. They gain advantage on the next roll to perform the task with which you are Helping. Alternately, assist them in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. The next attack roll that the Helped creature makes against this target, before the start of your next turn, has advantage.

- **Ready:** Hold off on another major or minor action. You determine a trigger and the action to use, then you can use it as a Reaction when the trigger is met. You must use it within one round of Readying it, or the opportunity is lost.

## Minor Actions

You only get one of these per turn, and these tend to be supplements to your major action. Many of these minor actions can be done as a free action, and can be done as many times as you can manage in this way.

- **Combo Attack:** If you use an abilitech with the Combo property as a major action with one hand, you can use a second abilitech with Combo, with the other hand.

- **Sylladex Ejection:** Make an attack roll, but instead of a stat mod and proficiency, add the skill bonus instead. It has the following attack profile:
	- 30 ft. range, single-target, ranged weapon attack, 1d4 damage, launches one item.
	- Sylladex ejection counts as a thrown weapon attack for the purposes of synergy with Pillars and Paths, alchemy, etc.

- **Discern:** You quickly make an observation about a creature or object you can see. Choose a piece of info you wish to learn (such as a creature’s hidden anatomy, stats, and other details at the SM's discretion) and make an Investigation or Perception check against the target. If the check beats the DC, you learn about it and can target it or otherwise interact with it.
	- In a strife, if you have no hidden anatomy left to Discern on a creature, you can choose to Discern them on a higher level, checking against their DC + 5. If your check beats that higher DC, you have advantage on damage dice against that creature for 1 round.
	- This can also be used to against psionic illusions and other optical or sensory phenomena in a strife, though this will likely be used by enemies against the player's illusions and the like.
	- There are a variety of other skills that can be used against creatures, depending on their type.
		- Animal Handling can be used against Underlings.
		- Medicine can be used against Biological creatures.
		- Engineering can be used against Mechanical creatures.
		- Occult can be used against Psionic creatures.
- **Inventory Usage:** You can take out or put in an item into your sylladex.
	- Putting armor/clothes on and off fall under here as well.
	- Switching between different specibi falls under here as well.
	- Switching between different weapons of the same specibi or changing the number of hands used on a versatile specibus, however, is a free action
	- You can switch out any configuration of specibi in your hands for any other configuration of specibi as one minor action.
	- For example, if you have Swordkind and Shieldkind equipped, you may switch to Pistolkind and Saddlekind as a single minor action.

- **Abilities:** There are plenty of Steps and classpect abilities that may require a minor action.
- **Aim:** Gain one d3 Aim die for one attack roll you make this turn, or grant an ally one d3 Aim die to the next attack roll made until the start of your next turn. Maybe you used some legerdemain, or pushed your mind, or deceived your enemy,
- **Avert:** Impose one d3 Block die to the next attack roll made against you until the start of your next turn, or one d3 Block die to the next attack roll made against an ally until the start of their next turn. Maybe you shrugged off the damage, or intimidated your enemy, or dodged it.
- **Assail:** Add a stat mod of your choice to a damage roll you make this turn, or add it to the next damage roll an ally makes until the start of your next turn. Maybe you pushed your muscles or your mind harder.
	- If an enemy creature Assails, it adds its damage mod listed in its stat block.
	- If a minion assails, it generally uses the player's stat of choice unless specified otherwise.

- **Distract:** You momentarily obscure your own position to gain an advantage. Choose a creature you can attack this turn, then make an opposed check, your Stealth against their Perception. If you succeed, your next attack roll against them this turn has +2 crit range.
	- If your target cannot draw line of sight to you (such as heavy obscuration), you have advantage on your check.
	- If your target would ordinarily have disadvantage to see you (such as light obscuration), they have disadvantage on their Perception check.
	- Distract, unlike Aim, Avert, and Assail, cannot be stacked unless specified otherwise.

## Movement

You start each round with speed equal to your base speed. You spend one foot of speed to move one foot. You have a speed of 30 feet unless specified otherwise. You can break up movement between actions as you please.

- **Alternate Movement:** If you have different movement modes, you can alternate between them as you wish, but the distance traveled can never exceed the maximum speed of your current mode. Actions that raise your speed, such as Dash, also raise this maximum.
	- Realistically we’ve done our best to make sure this never happens, for simplicity’s sake.
- **Dreamself Flight:** Dreamselves are capable of flight, with all the freedom it entails. Your dreamself’s fly speed is equal to your base speed.
- **Difficult Terrain:** Moving through this takes up an additional foot of speed per foot moved.
- **Being Prone:** Dropping Prone is free. Getting up from being Prone costs half your base speed. Moving costs an additional foot of speed per foot moved while Prone.
- **Moving Around Other Creatures:** You can move through non-hostile space freely. You can’t move through hostile creatures’ spaces. In either case, you can move through creatures’ spaces if they’re at least two size categories larger than you (typically Huge), and you can end your turn in said spaces.

## Reactions

You have one reaction per round. This reaction replenishes at the start of your turn.

- **Readied Action:** As described in Major Actions above, you can use one when the trigger is met.

- **Block:** Certain strife specibi, powers and Steps let you Block, imposing a Block die on an incoming attack roll.
	- The typical Block is one d4 die against one incoming attack roll that targets AC. If a Block granted by a Step is different from this, it will specify it in its description.

- **Abilities:** There are some Steps and classpect abilities that use reactions.

## Free Action

You have as many free actions per round as you wish, and you can do them at any time. Some may specify they can only be done on your turn.
- **Speech:** Talking is a free action. Within limit.
- **Object Interaction:** Trivial actions can be done freely. It is up to the SM whether a given activity is trivial enough.
	- Switching between different weapons in the same specibus is free.
- **Gambit Rounds:** Making gambit rolls for a given round is a free action for the rare case that a gambit might take place during a strife. In this case, gambit rounds and strife rounds are one and the same.

## Others

Some actions don’t fall into one of these categories.

- **Major and Minor Action:** Some actions need both a major and minor. This type of action is a separate category from major actions and minor actions.

- **Full-Round Action:** Some actions need a major, a minor, and ALL your speed. This type of action is a separate category from major actions and minor actions.

- **Stances:** Stances can have a variety of action costs for entering it. Some can require a minor action to enter and a free action to leave, but others might have other costs, or be conditionally free (such as entering it as part of rolling for initiative). The former (minor to enter, free to leave) is the default action cost for stances if its description does not specify otherwise.

- **Channeled Action:** Some actions need longer than a full-round action to perform, such as channeling a psionic ability. In this case, unless otherwise specified, it requires a major action on subsequent turns to maintain the channel.

- **Scrutinize:** You study a target or object over 1 minute, learning most hidden features/anatomy about a target, their current emotional state, and more information at the SM’s discretion.
	- Additionally, if you remained undetected by your target for the entirety of the action, if you make a melee attack with a finesse specibus on the target and you are still undetected, it automatically hits with advantage on the damage roll.
	- Alternately, you gain advantage on the next healing roll you make on them.

- **Rapid Action:** These are actions unique to Adversaries, RPGStuck's equivalent to bosses, where the adversary can replicate a major or move action, albeit at half strength. One rapid action can be taken between any two creatures' turns in a strife, even if the adversary is one of them. Typically, adversaries will have rapid actions when facing multiple players; the Denizen is an adversary, but has no rapid actions.
- **Scripted Action:** A scripted action is an action during a strife that immediately occurs at some specific instance, such as the start of each round.
