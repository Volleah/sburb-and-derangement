## Echeladder Rungs

Players gain experience points (XP) as they go through their adventures, tracked over the course of the session. At specific increments of XP they progress to the next level.

Whenever you gain a level, you move onto the next echeladder rung:

- Take your hit die average and add it to your hit dice column. Your current and max HP goes up by this. If your Constitution goes up, it retroactively increases all previous hit dice additions too.
- You gain a sum of boondollars (check the table in the next section).
- At levels 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20, you gain 2 stat points and 3 skill points you can distribute wherever you wish. No stat can be raised above 20, and no skill can be raised above its stat mod.
- At every even level, starting at 2, you gain one Step from Pillars and Paths.

- If you are a psion or hybrid, or you have certain specs/Steps, you might learn additional abilitechs and/or subpowers. See those relevant sections for more info.

- At levels 3, 7, 9, 13, and 15, you gain one Decor.

- At levels 3, 9, and 15, you gain a Stage, which lets you augment your skills further with Expertise (hone a single skill) or Polymath (gain extra skill points).

- At levels 5, 10, 15, and 20, your Proficiency bonus is increased by 1.
- At levels 5, 11, 17, and 19, you gain a Specialization.

Player Tier and Session Length

Player tier is a rough grouping of levels based on what tier alchemy the player can expect to have at any given level. This is typically used by SMs when assigning EXP, among other uses.

Players don't have a use for player tier per se, except when it comes to Session Length.

Session length represents the expected levels at which the session expects to start its endgame.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Character Experience Thresholds|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Level|XP need|XP total|Tier|BDs|Level|XP need|XP total|Tier|BDs|
|1|30|30|0|0|11|1595|5235|3|15950|
|2|100|130|1|800|12|1885|7120|3|18850|
|3|120|250|1|1200|13|2030|9150|3|21750|
|4|140|390|1|1600|14|2700|11850|4|24300|
|5|300|690|1/2|2400|15|2970|14820|4|29700|
|6|330|1020|2|3000|16|3510|18330|4|35100|
|7|360|1380|2|3600|17|3780|22110|4|40500|
|8|390|1770|2|4200|18|11200|33310|5|56000|
|9|420|2190|2|4800|19|14000|47310|5|84000|
|10|1450|3640|3|13050|20|n/a|n/a|5|112000|

For example, if a session is advertised as being length 1, it expects players to get to level 4 by the time it begins to end. It's not exact, there are length 1 sessions that end at level 6, or a length 3 that ends at 12. It's a loose approximation.

That said, for players that like to plan their builds, session length helps frame how many Steps they should expect, and the like.

## Classpects

Classpects are a perennially complex discussion as to who is which classpect (especially why) and what a player should expect from it. Given there are 144 classpect combinations (master classes, which are a whole nother conversation, are not included in this count), RPGStuck has opted to use a one size fits all approach.

The following is a basic set of classpect abilities and rules that ought to get you through your session. Your SM may add to it at their discretion (or replace it entirely with a system of their own making), but this is meant to be a baseline that can be adapted to just about any session's players.

You unlock these abilities at a narratively appropriate time at your SM's discretion, when it seems right that your character would start awakening to their latent powers.

#### Aspect Points

Aspect Points are a resource equal to the your Proficiency bonus by which you can leverage their aspect. They restore fully on a long rest. Your maximum AP increases by 1 per odd numbered gate completed (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th).

God Tiered players are able to restore 1 AP on a short rest.

AP will typically be reworded to fit the player's aspect, e.g. Breath players will use Breath Points, Light players have Light Points, etc.

#### Abilities

Players with access to their classpect start with the following two abilities:

- **Empower:** When the player makes an attack roll or skill check, they may spend 1 AP to roll with advantage. If making an attack roll, they add two d8 Aim dice. If making a skill check, they add two d8 Stakes dice. This can be used retroactively on a roll.

- The player should explain, in-character, how their aspect helps them.

- **Afflatus:** The player may spend 1 AP to ask a question about the scene, and the aspect answers back, in that aspect's unique way.

You may unlock more abilities as they progress through your session, at narratively appropriate times: the conclusion of odd-numbered gates (like max AP increases) would be appropriate, if nothing else comes to mind.

More information on this topic, as well as additional abilities you might gain in the future and what you gain after God Tiering, can be found in the [[Session Master's Assistant\|Session Master's Assistant]]

## XP/Boondollars Table

The second column describes the XP required for players to reach the next level, while boondollars describes the BDs gained for reaching that level.

- For example, a player that reaches level 6 would gain 3000 Boondollars, and would need 330 XP to reach level 7.

## Specializations

At levels 1, 5, 11, and 17, you choose specializations! At level 19, you may choose any one specialization from the levels 5, 11, or 17 lists that you have not previously chosen.

#### Level 1 Specs

- **All-Rounder:** You begin play with either 4 additional skill points, or a second strife specibus of choice. You are also probably more well-adjusted than some of these other choices.
- **Phantom:** You begin play as a ghost!
	- You hover instead of walking (you ignore physical difficult terrain), know the Augur affinity from Whispers, and have night vision.
	- Once per round, you can become Intangible as listed in conditions (or turn tangible again) as a reaction.
	- You are a ghost and no longer require food, drink, air, or sleep. However, you may fall into a dreamlike trance that is functionally sleeping for the purposes of resting and dreamself access, though you only need 6 hours of this to count as a long rest.
	- Your initiative rolls have disadvantage, but your Hit Die rolls/averages/max have +1.
	- Your spectral nature makes you more sensitive to psychic phenomena; whenever this sensitivity would come into play, you add one Flaws or Stakes die to the check, as appropriate.

- **Synthetic:** You begin play as a robot!
	- You have a natural +1 defense bonus. This is a bonus to AC and resists.
	- Whenever Medicine would be used on or against you, Engineering must be used instead.
	- You are a robot and no longer require food, drink, or air. You still require sleep, in order to recharge your batteries and access your dreamself as normal.
	- You cannot be psionically healed, nor do medicine, drugs, or other biological/chemical means have any effect on you.

- **Lucid Dreamer:** You begin play having already awakened on your dream moon before the events of the session. You have a fair understanding of the histories and social norms followed by carapacians, consorts, and other common inhabitants of the Incipisphere. You have one Stakes die to any non-strife checks made when dealing with them.
	- Talk with your SM about the specifics, like what moon they’re on, how long they’ve been awake, how being awake has changed them, and so on.
- **Heirloom:** You begin play with a special item!
	- You start with an equippable item of choice that carries a scaling effect that persists through alchemy.
	- Being one of the more versatile specs, Heirlooms are more prone to imbalance due to the many moving parts. As of this note’s writing, consult with your SM before taking this spec.

- **Companion:** You begin play with a small friend!
	- Your companion is a Tiny creature that shares your speed, your defenses plus six, and half your hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, they are knocked out and return fully healed after a short rest.
	- It moves during your turn, and can take one action of its own during your turn:
	- Make an attack (using your stats, melee 5 ft. or ranged 30 ft. of choice) against AC for Pd1+1 damage.
	- Use the Aim, Avert, or Assail actions, but it cannot use them on itself.

#### Level 5 Specs

- **Celerity:** When rolling for initiative at the start of a strife, if you are not surprised, you have advantage and +5 to the roll.
- **Weapon Proficiency:** Pick a strife specibus. You are now proficient with this strife specibus and immediately learn all its basic abilitechs. If you were already proficient with this, you instead learn one of its special abilitechs. Either way, you can then learn another special abilitech from this specibus whenever you learn a Step.
- **Path to Power:** Pick a psionic power. You immediately learn one subpower in this power. You then learn subpowers in this power as though you were a psion.
- **Lunge:** If you moved 20 feet or more towards a target before attacking them on the same turn, your damage roll against them has +2 die sizes.
- **Focus:** If there was no enemy within 10 feet of you at any point in the last round (6 seconds), you have +2 to your attack rolls.
- **Opportunism:** You gain the Opportunist milestone as described in Pillars and Paths. If you already have this, your Opportunist attacks additionally inflict Cripple (10) on the target.
- **Reckless Stance:** While in the Reckless Stance, as a free action you give advantage to all attack rolls from or against you, for 1 round.

#### Level 11 Specs

- **Resilience:** Choose one resistance. You become proficient with this resistance, adding your Proficiency bonus to it. You cannot choose a resistance in which you are already proficient.
- **Inviolable:** Once per strife, as a free action to being hit, you may make an Endurance or Sanity check, of your choice. If your check beats the attack roll, the attacker is considered Weakened for that attack, and you treat it as if it only did damage and no other effects.
- **Prism:** When rolling hit dice, other than to determine your new maximum HP total, you add your PCM in addition to your Constitution modifier.
- **Meditation:** P/2 times per long rest, as a major action, make a skill check with your psionic casting skill or Endurance, of your choice. You then gain the roll as temporary hit points. This temp HP stacks with temp HP from other sources. Alternately, you may do this as part of a major action that also grants temp HP.
- **Nimble:** Once per round, you have Aegis, equal to STR or DEX, of your choice, against the first instance of damage you take.

#### Level 17 Specs

- **Cutting Edge:** You gain +2 crit range.
- **Superior Block:** Once per strife, when you impose Block dice on an attack and it still hits, you reduce the damage dealt by 50% as a free action.
- **Martial Training:** You gain +1 to hit with attack rolls, +1 to your AC, and +1 to all resistances.
- **Shrouded:** Once per strife, as a free action but only on your turn, you go Invisible for 1 round or until you use a major action.
- **Second Strike:** Once per strife, if you would have advantage to hit with a damaging attack, you can forego this advantage to make a second attack after the first. If used, neither attack may benefit from advantage.
