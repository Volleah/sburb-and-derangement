| Detect Psionics (affinity)  | You gain a sixth sense attuned to psionic emanations. Your ability to Discern and Scrutinize extends to nearby psionics within 100 feet, whether it be psionic beings, items, phenomena, etc. You can use your psionic skill for those abilities where necessary, and the SM may require such a check to tell specific details about some psionic signature, detect some subtle or otherwise concealed psionics, or some other use for this sixth sense, at the SM's discretion.<br><br>You can spend a lesser slot to heighten your psi sense, allowing you to know and track the locations of all creatures with psionic natures, foci, or other psionic features within 100 feet for 30 minutes. At the SM's discretion, you might also spend a lesser slot to track the trails of psionic creatures or telepathic conversations, automatically pass some check where this affinity came into play, or otherwise supercharge your psi sense to attempt something extraordinary with your affinity not covered in this writing.<br><br>This affinity is used as a free action if an action cost is not given elsewhere. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Counterpsi (channeled)      | Major action: You push your affinity to nullify the works of psions. For the next hour, you can dismantle psionic phenomena within range. This typically takes 1 minute and does not need a check, though the SM may raise the channeling time needed, require a check, and/or spend a lesser slot, at their discretion. As a rule of thumb, something complex might need 10 minutes and have the dismantling be easily detected, something reactive might need a check with consequences for failure, and something fortified against antipsions might need a lesser slot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Counterpsi (lesser)         | Reaction: Make an attack roll against an incoming psionic ability. If your attack roll is greater than the incoming roll (if the ability did not need an attack roll, the caster must make one now), the ability is considered to have missed. If you can grant Block dice for allies within a certain distance as a reaction, you can use this reaction against attacks on allies within this distance as well.<br><br>Alternately, make a psionic skill check to immediately end some ongoing psionic ability of a target within range, rolling against the target's DC.

| Icy Touch (affinity)      | You gain a psionic ability to create and reshape ice. You can turn water into ice with a touch, and can freely and quickly turn water under your feet to ice. You can also shape ice as if you were physically shaping malleable clay; this typically is a channeled action and does not need a check, though the SM may require a check and/or a lesser slot, at their discretion.<br><br>As a rule of thumb, creating something intricately detailed or in need of finesse might require a check with consequences like breakage on failure. Something that needs power, like fortifying ice to endure in hot weather, creating and reshaping massive amounts of ice in a short time without an easy water supply, trying to freeze an entire lake at once, or freezing liquids with lower freezing points than water might require a lesser slot. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Glacial Path (at-will)    | Major action: You push your affinity to sap heat more generally. For the next hour, you can remove the heat from an object or environment. This typically takes a major action and does not need a check, though the SM may require a channeling time, a check, and/or a lesser slot, at their discretion. As a rule of thumb, cooling an entire house might need 5 minutes' worth of channeling, using this force in some unconventional or delicate way might need a check with consequences like overload on failure, and snuffing out a fire or some active heat source might need a lesser slot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Battery (affinity)       | You gain a psionic ability to channel electrical power. As a baseline, you are able to power any common household item to operate for P hours. This typically takes a major action and does not need a check, though the SM may require a channeling time, a check, and/or a lesser slot, at their discretion. As a rule of thumb, powering up minor industrial tools and other high-expenditure devices might need a lesser slot or 15 minutes' worth of channeling, while powering something delicate or damaged that requires finesse might require a check with consequences like blowout on failure.<br><br>Additionally at the SM's discretion, you can spend a lesser slot to supercharge your affinity to attempt something unconventional with it you normally would not be able to do. You can also spend a greater slot to supply an incredible amount of power with no upper limit except the SM's discretion, though such extraordinary expenditures, such as powering up an abandoned laboratory complex, probably has side effects like unconsciousness, bodily harm, exhaustion, and temporarily burning out the psion's electrokinesis. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

You can telepathically speak with other creatures within range as if you were speaking to them in person. You can also read the surface thoughts of others as a channeled action as if you were reading a book; this does not need a check, though the SM may require a lengthy channel time, a check, and/or a lesser slot, at their discretion.<br><br>As a rule of thumb, plumbing the depths of someone's mind or something lengthy might require 30 minutes, trying to invade a mind actively resisting you or avoiding psionic mind blocks might require a check with consequences like shutout or injury on failure, and linking several minds into a telepathic chat room or something similarly unconventional might require a lesser slot.<br><br>You can spend a lesser slot to heighten your sensitivity, allowing you to know and track the locations and moods of emotion-capable creatures within range for 30 minutes. At the SM's discretion, you might also spend a lesser slot to automatically pass some check where this affinity came into play, or otherwise supercharge your affinity to attempt something extraordinary not covered in this writing.<br><br>You can also channel for 1 minute with a person within range to form an Empathic Bond with them, a telepathic bond that allows the two of you to telepathically converse regardless of distance, perceive through each others' senses, and tag the other person as an Empathic Bond, who also benefits from several EMC subpowers. This bond lasts for 24 hours or until you sever it as a free action. |

As a baseline, these images are of Medium size or smaller, are intangible, have limited animation, cannot shed light, cannot harm someone, and lasts 1 minute or until out of range. This typically takes a major action and does not need a check, though the SM may require a channeling time, a check, and/or a lesser slot, at their discretion.<br><br> As a rule of thumb, creating and maintaining a score of illusions for extended amounts of time might need you to channel for that duration, something bizarre and psychedelic and requires someone actually skilled in audiovisuals might require a check with consequences like not actually fooling anybody on a failure, and fortifying an illusion to last a day outside of your range might require a lesser slot.<br><br>Any illusions modified by a lesser slot subpower can also last up to a day and can exist outside your range unless specified otherwise. At your SM's discretion, you might also spend a lesser slot to attempt something extraordinary with your affinity not covered in this writing.<br><br>This affinity is used as a major action if an action cost must be specified. |

At your SM's discretion, it can be used to create some other falsifiable quality not covered above.<br><br>Major action: Empower your affinity to rewrite illusions' psionic makeups. For the next hour, you can use your affinity to reorder your illusions, diminishing their psionic signatures against detection or rewriting them to be indistinguishable from ordinary psionic beings, items, phenomena, etc. It will be sufficient to fool cursory inquiries, though it may not stand up to thorough or powerful scrutiny. Alternately, you may use it to create illusions of purely psionic energy, to bait or mislead psionic detection and extrasensory perceptions.<br><br>Major action: Empower your affinity to stabilize your illusions.

| Hot Touch, ability (affinity)                                  | You gain a psionic ability to start, fuel, and stop fires. You can set objects on fire as if you had a lighter. This typically takes a major action and does not need a check, though the SM may require a channeling time, a check, and/or a lesser slot, at their discretion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Hot Touch, rules (affinity)                                    | As a rule of thumb, something like burning down an entire orphanage or some broad area might require either 15 minutes' worth of channeling and sufficient tinder, or several casts at specific and vulnerable locations, burning through metal or something similarly durable might require a lesser slot, and applying heat in a physically unnatural or otherwise unconventional manner might require a check with consequences like misfiring on failure.                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Your ability to Discern and Scrutinize extends to nearby biologicals within 100 feet, whether it be their health, afflictions, new or old injuries, etc. You can interchangeably use your psionic skill or Medicine for those abilities where necessary, and the SM may require such a check to tell specific details about a creature's biology, detect infection vectors in an area, or some other use for this sixth sense, at the SM's discretion.<br><br>Your healing is more effective on creatures you have recently Scrutinized, or Discerned on the same turn as the heal. If rolling for healing, you may reroll the amount healed. If healing a flat amount, add your PCM to it.<br><br>You can spend a lesser slot to heighten this sixth sense, allowing you to sense and track the locations of living creatures within this range for 30 minutes. At the SM's discretion, you might also spend a lesser slot to track the trails of living creatures, automatically pass some check where this affinity came into play, or otherwise supercharge your psi sense to attempt something extraordinary with your affinity not covered in this writing.<br><br>This affinity is used as a free action if an action cost is not given elsewhere. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Notes: If a target is unwilling to receive healing from any Radionics subpower, you must make an attack roll against their Fortitude resistance. Any healing received from Radionics cannot critically hit, damage from Radionics can. If you break resistance, the subpower works as described.<br><br>Additionally, the healing done by Radionics subpower counts as an landing an attack (but cannot benefit from anything that specifies an attack roll), and the healing done counts as damage, for the purposes of interaction with Pillars and Paths, etc. For example, damage dice size increases and Assail would both increase the healing done. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Lift (affinity)             | You gain a psionic ability to lift things with the power of your mind. As a baseline, you are able to lift as much as you might be able to carry with one arm, keeping any lifted objects within range and in sight, though it has no talent for dextrous manipulation and you can only focus on one thing at a time. This is typically channeled as long as something is being lifted and does not need a check, though the SM may require a check and/or a lesser slot, at their discretion.<br><br>As a rule of thumb, lifting a sofa or something you might hesitate to lift without help might need a lesser slot, and expending a lesser slot empowers you long enough to do so for an hour. Picking a lock from a distance or something similar that requires sleight of hand, or some burst of telekinetic strength too short to want to spend a lesser slot, might require a check, with consequences like breakage on failure.<br><br>Additionally at the SM's discretion, you can spend a greater slot to supercharge your affinity with no specific upper limit except the SM's discretion, though such extraordinary expenditures, such as lifting a car, probably has side effects like unconsciousness, bodily harm, exhaustion, and temporarily burning out the psion's telekinesis.<br><br>Without blowback, however, you can spend a greater slot to empower your affinity to lift yourself in what is functionally flight for an hour. ...given you remember to not stop channeling, of course. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Your ability to Discern and Scrutinize extends to such things within 100 feet, whether it be ghostly beings, items, phenomena, etc. You can interchangeably use your psionic skill or Occult for those abilities where necessary, and the SM may require such a check to tell specific details about some ghostly signature, detect some subtle or otherwise concealed spectral magic, or some other use for this sixth sense, at the SM's discretion.<br><br>You can spend a lesser slot to heighten your psi sense, allowing you to know and track the locations of all creatures with psionic natures, foci, or other psionic features within 100 feet for 30 minutes. At the SM's discretion, you might also spend a lesser slot to track the trails of undead creatures, automatically pass some check where this affinity came into play, or otherwise supercharge your psi sense to attempt something extraordinary with your affinity not covered in this writing.<br><br>This affinity is used as a free action if an action cost is not given elsewhere. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
