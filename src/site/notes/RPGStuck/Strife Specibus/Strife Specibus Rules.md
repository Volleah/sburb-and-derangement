## Choose Your Strife Specibus

>[!quote] “What kinda nerd walks around with an unallocated strife specibus?”

Strife specibi come in many shapes and varieties. Every specibus is marked with certain tags to help identify how they work (which we will quickly cover below). Each specibus has a number of unique **abilitechs**, which come in several varieties.

>[!important] Varieties of Abilitechs
>- Basic Abilitechs are fundamental to the given specibus: everyone knows how to use them. A basic abilitech’s name is listed in bold.
>- Special Abilitechs are more specialized trick with a specibus; martials begin play with all of their special abilitechs known, but hybrids have to learn them and psions can't use them at all.
>- Certain abilitechs aren't tied to a specibus. These typically come from Steps in PnP.

To use an abilitech with a specibus, expend the type of action listed (such as a major action or minor action). For an attack roll, you then roll a d20 and add your Proficiency (P) and the specibus’ associated Stat Modifier. If your attack hits, roll damage according to the listed damage for that attack.

Speaking of hands, a specibus may be held in either one or two hands when attacking, and will be marked according to how many hands are required.

But some weapons are versatile, meaning you are able to use it with one hand (damage values listed assume such), or switch to using both to increase the damage of your attacks by one die step.

There is also the occasional double weapon, which is a specibus that has two pieces held in each hand, which are generally used together for combo attacks. These require two hands to wield, but unlike a two-handed weapon it is possible to drop one half of a double weapon to free a hand and continue fighting, but you cannot combo (by itself; you can still combo if your other hand has a combo specibus or is free to use a combo subpower) or use any special abilitechs with only half of the specibus.

>[!info] Categories of Specibi are as listed:
>- Melee Specibi are primarily useful for up close and personal fights.
>- Ranged Specibi will always use Dexterity (DEX), and are useful at a normal range (listed in the specibus itself), and a little less useful when extended to their maximum range (this is called their long range, not all ranged specibi have this) and melee range (within 5 ft., usually). If making an attack outside of normal range, you roll at disadvantage to hit.
>- Thrown Specibi are much like ranged specibi, only they do not suffer from disadvantage at certain ranges, and might be used with Strength (STR) instead. However, they tend towards a much shorter range.
>	- Uniquely, certain abilitechs can be counted as thrown when used; ranged abilitechs without a rounds/charges or cache cost on a melee specibus also count as thrown specibi when the ranged attack is made.
>- And Special Specibi are the snowflakes that do not fit well into the above two groups for one reason or another. It either mixes melee and ranged attacks to not fit into the melee or ranged categories, has a large abilitech list but some of the abilitechs provide support and utility than damage, or the specibus is another being in its own right!

>[!info] And they can have certain tags about them.
>- **Brutality** always utilizes your Strength (STR) modifier.
>- **Finesse** allows you to choose between STR and Dexterity (DEX).
>- **Esoteric** always utilizes whatever modifier is listed for it.
>- **Reload** specibi requires ammunition (which you are considered to keep in ample supply, no worries!) and can hold a certain number of rounds/charges. You cannot use an abilitech that expends them if you do not have any to spend; once all rounds have been expended, the specibus must be reloaded to continue attacking.
>- **Combo** tagged abilitechs (or subpowers!) allow for combo attacks, allowing you to make a combo attack as a major action, then another as a minor action. This minor action attack's damage roll doesn't add any listed stat mods to damage. Combo attack abilitechs are italicised.
>	- If you make two abilitech combo attacks, you make them with each hand, requiring you to have the appropriate weapon in each hand, with two halves of a double weapon in your hands, two copies of a one-handed specibus in your hands, or a two-handed specibus.
>	- If you make two subpower combo attacks, you must do so with both hands free to use the power (or powers, if you roll that way). However, the damage from combo subpowers ignore the +1 die size for wielding a versatile power with both hands.
>	- Yes, you can mix abilitech and subpower combo attacks together, just have a combo weapon in one hand and the other hand available to use the combo subpower.
>- **Encore** tagged abilitechs allow for encore attacks, which cycles between two different modes listed in its description, numbered 1 and 2. When you use the 1st mode of any encore abilitech, the next time you use any encore abilitech, you use its 2nd mode instead, after which you revert back to the 1st mode. Encore attack abilitechs are underlined.
>	- You cannot use both the 1st and 2nd modes of an abilitech on the same turn. You cannot use an encore abilitech outside of a strife, and all encores revert to the 1st mode at the start of a strife.
>	- You can, however, use the 1st mode of an abilitech, then use the 2nd mode of a different abilitech next turn.
>	- Certain abilitechs only have a 2nd mode, relying on the 1st mode from a root abilitech, so to speak. In these cases, it shares the same action cost and damage (if any) as the abilitech it's in.
>- **Momentum** tagged abilitechs allow for momentum attacks, allowing you to make two attacks as a major and minor action. However, every consecutive use of a Momentum abilitech adds an additional attack to the attacks made, up to 2 additional attacks per turn, to a maximum of 5 attacks total. These additional attacks reset on using any other major and/or minor abilitech.
>	- Non-abilitechs major and/or minor actions, such as Defend, Help, Aim, Avert, or Assail, do not reset bonus attacks.
>- **Lunge** tagged abilitechs allow for lunge attacks, where if you move at least 20 feet towards your target before attacking them that same turn, the abilitech has +1 die size.
>	- If you inflict forced movement on your target to move them closer to you, this also qualifies towards the 20 ft. requirement, as long as the movement was also inflicted on the same turn as the attack.
>	- Alternately, if a target moves at least 20 feet towards you on their turn, if you can attack them with a lunge abilitech on your turn (such as a Readied action or a reaction), it also benefits.
>- **Cache** tagged specibi also require ammunition to use most or all abilitechs, but these cannot be restored during strife once they are spent, instead replenished during a short rest (you are able to replenish your cache, you do not have to tediously scrounge for supplies).
>- **Control** tagged specibi have a control radius in which the specibus can act (and do not act if taken out of this range); rideable specibi like bikes and controllable specibi like puppets fall into this category. They move on your turn as you will them, but cannot perform any other actions without you. You'll notice your abilitechs specify that your minion is the one doing them, but just as you would roll to hit with a sword or roll to grapple with a whip, you provide any rolls on your minion's behalf.
>	- All control specibi count as minions while in use; more specifically, they count as allies while in use, for certain Steps and other abilities that might rely on this. However, this specibi also comes with its own hit points; if it is reduced to 0 HP, it is rendered unusable and requires a short rest to restore to full HP.

Most (but not all) abilitechs have a listed damage, with Q (the quality of your weapon, all weapons start at tier 0, where Q=1), a die in parentheses, and a stat mod to add (again, most but not all have this).

This die in the parentheses (e.g. the d6 in 2Qd6+DEX) can be increased, typically through Steps and other abilities you might learn as you play through your session. These will denote that the die size is being increased.

>[!info] The range of dice sizes goes as such: 
>d2, d3, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, then 2d8, 2d10, 2d12.
>	- If a damage die size needs to exceed 2d12, you instead add 2P or your Level, of your choice, to the damage roll instead.
>	- For example, +2 die sizes to a d6 would become d10, for Qd10+DEX, +2 die sizes to a d10 would become 2d8, for 2Qd8+DEX.
>	- Whereas +1 die size to 2Qd12+STR would become 2Qd12+STR+2P or 2Qd12+STR+Level.
>	- And +2 die sizes to 2Qd12+STR would become 2Qd12+STR+Level+Level.
>	- Or 2Qd12+STR+Level+2P, whatever floats your boat.
>	- If a damage die size ever needs to reduce below d2, you instead subtract P from the damage roll instead.
>- The range goes 2d2, 2d3, 2d4, 2d6, then 2d8, 2d10, 2d12 as normal, for some abilitechs whose damage dice don't fall in the scale above.
>- Certain abilitechs have dice like 3Qd3, or 3Qd4. The range for these goes 3d1, 3d2, 3d3, 3d4, 3d6, 3d8, 3d10, 3d12. If it needs to exceed 3d12, add 2P or Level, of your choice, same as above.
>- If the abilitech lists it as flat damage (such as Q or 2Q), you instead add +Q to the damage dealt for each time you would raise the die size.
>- Any die sizes bonuses only apply to the base damage roll, not any bonus damage added to the initial roll, unless the Step or other effect that adds the bonus specifies as such. Typically, they will specify that it counts as an abilitech and/or subpower.
>- The Empower condition is also included in this delineation.

Phew! Did you catch all of that? Good! Remember, everyone gets at one! Your character begins play with one T0 weapon allocated to each specibus, the details of which are up to you to describe.
