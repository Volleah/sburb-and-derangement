| Notes: When you equip BotKind, you gain two robotic minions under your control (and a gun). They are small, with 10*Q hit points, AC/resistances of 18+Q, and a speed equal to your base speed.<br><br>You can prime a bot over the course of one minute, hiding it and readying it to activate at a later time, similar to a bomb, or a roomba with a claymore. Use your cache stat as the DC where a primed bot might be spotted early. A bot can move at half speed while primed, and stops being primed after using an abilitech that costs rounds. |          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
