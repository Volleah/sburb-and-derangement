"Why do the imps look like Ben Stiller?"

#### The Basics

Prototyping occurs when a player must throw something into their sprite during the entry process. Among other things, the things thrown into their sprites affect how the underlings behave and act.

Prototyping encompasses a wide variety:

- Affinities, same as those of psionic powers, represent certain powers monsters might have as a result of their prototypings.
- Abilities, which are either new actions a monster can perform, or a modification of some action they can already perform.
- Traits, which changes something fundamental about the creature.

We don't have an official recommendation for how many prototyping effects you should have on your underlings. Instead, start with one or two, then work your way up until you feel comfortable with the underlings. That said, you can always throw in more or less if your players prototyped anything particularly benign or dangerous.

And you should always feel free to make up effects of your own.

##### Archetype

You might solidify a given monster's role in a strife by giving it an archetype.

#### Modifying Monsters

If you'd like to workshop monsters of your own, you can use the Bestiary Workshop tab in the SM Session Sheet to make it. If you'd like to see how the numbers are broken down though, this is the right place.

A monster's Tier determines its damage, HP, hit bonus, base defense, DC, and stat bonuses. It also determines their EXP and drops as well. Its damage, HP, and hit bonus are also different if the creature is a Horde, which works differently from a normal monster in two ways. Its damage output scales on its HP, and it is more vulnerable to area of effect abilities.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Base|   |   |   |Single|   |Horde|   |
|Tier|DC|Defense|HP|Damage|Hit Bonus|Damage|Hit Bonus|
|0|10|13|7|1|5|1|0|
|1|15|14|15|2|6|1|1|
|2|15|14|40|8|7|3|1|
|3|20|15|80|15|8|6|2|
|4|20|15|125|25|9|10|2|
|5|20|16|200|40|10|15|3|

The monster's damage, HP, and loot/EXP drops is then multiplied depending on its CR. Its CR is dependent on the template given to the creature.

The monsters' damage and HP are multiplied:

- Basic: Basics are CR 1. Damage, HP, and drops are unchanged.
- Lancer: Lancers are CR 2. It has 1.5x damage, 2x HP, 3x drops
- Glacier: Glaciers are CR 2. It has 1.25x damage, 2.5x HP, 3x drops
- Specialist: Specialists are CR 2. It has 1.75x damage and HP, 3x drops.
- Slayer: Slayers are CR 3. It has 2x damage, 3x HP, 6x drops.
- Adversary: Adversaries are CR 4. It has 2.5x damage, 4x HP, 10x drops.

And Hordes too, though they have a separate damage progression from singles:

- Horde: Hordes are CR 1. Damage, HP, and drops are unchanged.
- Mob: Mobs are CR 2. It has 2.67x damage, 3x HP, 3x drops.
- Swarm: Swarms are CR 3. It has 3.5x damage, 5.75x HP, 6x drops.
- Legion: Legions are CR 4. It has 4x damage, 9x HP, 10x drops.

A creature's damage mod is 40% of their base damage.

In general, the loot/EXP drop modifier remains the same. CR 1 is unchanged, CR 2 grants thrice the usual amount, CR 3 grants six times, and CR 4 grants ten times. This pattern can be extended to higher CRs, with fifteen for CR 5, twenty-one for CR 6, twenty-eight for CR 7, etc, though RPGStuck isn't balanced to scale that high for CR.

The monster blocks as presented in the Bestiary also optionally have some of the following modifications:

- Their HP is raised by 10% in exchange for -1 to AC/resistances (up to +30% max HP for -3 AC/resists), or lowered by 10% in exchange for +1 to AC/resistances (up to -30% max HP and +3 AC/resists).
- Their damage is raised by 20% in exchange for -2 to hit, or lowered by 20% for +2 to hit.
- They have Aegis (X), but reduce their max HP by X times their CR.
- Certain T1 creatures have lower damage than they ought so they don't paste low level players too easily.
- Each of their resistances can be modified by up to 2 in either direction (Reflex for a T4 creature might be low as 13 or high as 17). There is no mechanical conceit for balance for this, and is primarily done by vibes.
- They have +5 to initiative, or -5 to initiative. There is no mechanical conceit for balance for this, and is primarily done by vibes.

If creating an Adversary or Legion (boss blocks) for multiple players, give them 75% bonus HP per additional player (4 players would have 225% bonus HP, so a T5 Adversary would have 200 HP, then 4x HP for being an Adversary to 800 HP, then 225% bonus HP for 2600 HP total.)

Their damage remains constant, instead granting them the Rapid Action trait. Between two creatures' turns, the boss may perform a major action or move action. Any direct damage dealt or distance moved by a rapid action is halved. They may do this once per round per extra player (4 players would see the boss do this thrice a round.)

Developer's Note (2023-06-19): To be expanded with additional items as time goes on.

##### Challenges

A challenge refers to any special scripted action in a strife that comes in multiple forms.

The most common version is the Setpiece or the Sequence, wherein when an Adversary falls to half HP or less, the strife pauses and the player is called to make one or more skill check. These challenges incorporate some manner of fictional circumstance outside of a strife, such as a Denizen setting the world on fire, or the Black Queen using Red Miles. The skill check(s) represent the player's response to the Adversary's actions.

An example is provided below, assuming the Denizen to be the bearer of the challenge.

- Cataclysmic Setpiece: The Denizen flexes their strength as the player's final test by working a terrifying display of power that attempts to put the player down right then and there. The player must make a single skill check; any skill is allowed so long as the player can justify it, or come up with your own list of usable skills ahead of time. The consequences depend on the highest DC passed.

- None: This means the player got a total of 9 or less, and they either decided not to reroll or the dice gods have sentenced the player to pain unending. The player takes [base damage + 3 mods] damage.
- DC 10: The player doesn't fare too well and takes the brunt of the damage, but shouldn't one hit kill them. The player takes [base damage + 1 mod] damage.
- DC 20: The player mitigates most of the Denizen's power, taking relative scratch damage. The player takes [base damage - 1 mod] damage.
- DC 30: The player proves themselves the Denizen's equal, taking no damage whatsoever, then coming out renewed. The player takes no damage.
- DC 40/Crit: At SM's discretion, you can also grant the player advantage for the remainder of the phase/strife, refund AP, and/or other effects as desired, if they rolled a nat 20, rolled very, very high, or otherwise feel deserving of it.

- The Quicktime Sequence: The Denizen mixes up the strife, requiring the player to make two to four checks in sequence, a list of usable skills given for each check. The player takes true damage equal to the Denizen's damage mod per failed check, either all at the end or after each check as failed, whichever makes more sense in-universe. If all checks passed, the player takes advantage to attack rolls for the remainder of the phase/strife.

- Skirmish: A clash of blades, a display of prowess, a test of your reflexes.
- Enigma: A new unknown, a puzzle that must be solved, a complexity that portends danger if left unchecked.
- Seal: A barrier, an obstacle that must be overcome, a force that prevents progress until resolved.
- Desolation: A mental assault, a corrupting influence, resisting the mental flensing of one's mind and emotions.
- Agony: A physical agony, a pain or toxin or force, some incoming hurty thing that cannot be dodged, only endured.
- Rhetoric: An argument, a decisive retort, taking talking is a free action to its natural conclusion.
- Flight: A measured or messy retreat, a stealthy hunkering down, escaping approaching doom by any means.
- Pursuit: A chase scene, a search for the hidden, take Flight but be on the other side.

It may be easier to think of the Quicktime Sequence as… exactly that, a mid-fight QTE you might see in a video game.

These are intended to be used for Adversaries, but there's nothing stopping you from adding these to lesser CR enemies besides your judgment. Don't use them too often, or at least make them simplistic if used as such. A single skill check at half HP to see if the player can execute the creature in some fashionably flashy quicktime event wouldn't be amiss.

An alternate use for a Challenge is allowing mid-strife gambits. In this case, the player may initiate or continue a gambit at the start of each round, rolling once per round (or one exchange in the case of an opposed gambit).

An example is provided below, taken from Scenariostuck.

Challenge: The player may initiate a strife gambit or continue one at the start of each round, rolling once per round. This gambit is to either discern Minecraft Steve's fighting style using Investigation or Insight or some appropriate skill check, or wear down his will to fight with Insight or some Charisma check of choice. Players can perform multiple gambits over the course of the strife.

- Fighting Style: A gambit to discern his fighting style decreases his defenses by 4 on a success, or less on a partial. If failed, he raises his defenses by 2 as he wisens up.
- Break Will: A gambit to wear down his will forces a d6 Block die on all his rolls, or d3s on a partial. If failed, he gains a d3 Aim die on all his rolls as his resolve strengthens.

##### Adversary Traits

These are traits you might add onto an Adversary to make them even tougher. At your discretion, add them to non-adversaries too.

- Rising Danger: Some combatants cannot be fought in a battle of attrition. Whenever this creature misses an attack roll, it gains a stacking +2 bonus (to +6) until it lands an attack roll. Whenever this creature lands a non-crit attack roll, it gains a stacking +2 crit (to +6) until it lands an attack roll. Whenever this creature lands a critical hit, it imposes a stack of the condition Rising Danger; a creature with three stacks of Rising Danger is reduced to 0 hit points.
- Improved Grievous Wounds: This creature inflicts Grievous Wounds with certain attacks. This is a unique condition; when it reaches two stacks, it resets and the target takes 2*Level true damage. Lasts until a short rest.
- Blood Moon: If Grievous Wounds reaches max stacks and resets, dealing damage to the player (or other target), this creature has +1 damage mod on all attacks.
- Legendary Attacker: Whenever this creature would attack at advantage, they instead make two attacks without it. If they would make it at double advantage, they instead make three attacks without it.
- Companion: This creature is accompanied by a companion that occupies the same square. It has a single minor action on each of the creature's turns with which it may Aim, Avert, Assail, Distract, or Discern for them. It shares the same AC/resistances and has no HP, but is Incapacitated (2 rounds) if hit.
- Paradox Possibility: Once per round, this creature takes advantage on a d20 roll.
