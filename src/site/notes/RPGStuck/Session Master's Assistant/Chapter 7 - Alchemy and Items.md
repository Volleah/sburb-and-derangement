"I feel like this shouldn’t be as difficult as we’ve made it out to be."

#### Introduction

Alchemy is a process by which items are duplicated and/or combined to create new items. It serves an important role in entry, and throughout the entire game, and is one of the bigger draws of RPGStuck as a system.

There are two separate concepts to tackle: the physical process of alchemy in the session, and the purpose of alchemy from an SM’s viewpoint.

The actual process of alchemy requires checking the code on the back of a captchalogue card with the item, putting a spare card into the punch designix with the card, and punching the card with the code. This punched card is then put into a totem lathe with a cruxite dowel to carve the totem. This totem is then placed on the alchemiter, and it produces the item at the cost of grist, the tier of the item dependent on the tier of grist spent.

In practice, the process tends to be hand-waved, skipping directly to combining items for alchemy with the preceding processes assumed off-screen.

There are two ways to combine when alchemizing, && and ||.

- X && Y, or X AND Y for those familiar with computer programming, combines the form and function of X and Y.
- X || Y, or X OR Y, retains the function of X or Y, but keeps the form of the other, Y or X.
- X && Y || Z, or X AND Y OR Z, combines the form and function of X and Y, then keeps its form or function while Z takes the other, the function or form.

Then there is the purpose of alchemy from outside the in-universe perspective, which is to improve a player’s gear and increase their overall power. This is a simple concept that belies an open-ended problem, which will be explored further in the next section.

As the SM, alchemy is in your hands to do with as you please, both a power and a burden. You determine what a given alchemy combination does, with all its effects and limitations.

|Notes: Accessories and non-equipped items come at half the cost.<br><br>T0: Build grist, the base tier 0 material, is highlighted because items typically cost only build grist (for mundane items and the like), or cost tiered grist but no T0 (tiered alchemy).|   |   |   |   |   |   |

Instead of describing specific items, this document aims to list Tags instead, which denote a particular effect. Instead of creating specific items, you instead create items that happen to fit the effects of all the tags.

For example, a psi focus is listed as a tag under the psionics category. Foci can take all sorts of shapes, but they all serve a common function.

Some tags will have an indented entry for higher tiers. These entries will list suggestions for how to improve the tag; we recommend taking one of the suggestions (not all of them) as sufficient for an upgrade, though you have the final say.

#### Utility Tags

Here is a list of utility tags, organized by function.

Utility tags are assumed to be Tier 0 and therefore cost only Build Grist. If the tag is recommended to be built with tiered grist, it will specify so in the tag's name.

Alchemy with utility tags typically will not produce weapons or wardrobes (with the rare exception for a psi foci). Therefore, all items here cost half the amount listed in the grist costs table.

Rarely, they will specify the item should cost extra (such as a car). In this case, apply the multiplier after halving the cost first.

Or they specify multiples (such as small cameras). In this case, the usual cost will create as many as listed in the multiple.

##### Stealth

The Stealth tag denotes items and effects that allow one to act without being detected.

- Underling Wards (T0): Klaxons, jack in the boxes, analog jumpscares, etc that are harmless but effective at scaring off wandering underlings. One per entrance should be enough to cover a house or other building. Will not deter especially determined ones.

#### Combat Tags

Here is a list of combat tags, organized by how they enhance a player's ability to throw down.

Combat tags are assumed to cost tiered grist, as they typically go on alchemized weapons, wardrobe, and accessories. Therefore, they will have a baseline tier associated with them.

You can always throw on multiple tags to approximate a higher tier tag. For example, if you want to create a T3 item, you can slap three T1 tags together and call it a day. If you want to create a T4 item, you can use four T1 tags, two T2 tags, a T2 tag and two T1 tags, a T3 tag and T1 tag, etc.

There are also legendary tags for alchemy made with the Denizen's grist hoard in preparation for the endgame. You can approximate them by doubling their tier, so a T4 tag would approximate a T2 Legendary.

That said, we do not recommend reverse-engineering this, having a T1 Legendary substitute for a T2 tag. These are meant for the endgame and are disproportionately powerful to have.

- Any tags indented below a legendary is meant for accessories to supplement the original legendary tag.

If a given tag specifies a given specibus, or power, or specific abilitechs/subpowers, it will be listed in its name. You are free to take the tag and apply it to other specibi or powers anyway, though adapting it is left up to you.

Developer's Note (02/28/2022): This is still a work in progress; you might be asking why we haven't organized them according to specibi or powers. The answer is that we don't have enough tags to warrant that. If we get enough we'll do it in the future, but for now, ctrl+f to search by specific terms.

##### Extra Abilitechs/Subpowers

The Extra Abilitech/Subpowers tag denotes items and effects that add additional abilitechs and subpowers that can be used.

- Unwieldy Obstruction (T1): The weapon or focus becomes physically large or obstructive enough to allow a reaction to impose -2 to one attack roll targeting AC.

- Return To Sender (Thrown tag, Throw T1): Reaction: After making a ranged attack with this abilitech, repeat the attack as it comes back for a second go. This deals half damage. If the abilitech allows +1 die size if the ranged abilitech is made as a melee attack, add that +1 die size when using this reaction.

- To Whom it May Concern (T1): The projectile explodes. It now targets Reflex but hits everyone within a 10 ft. radius of the target.
- Reply All (T1): The projectile is electrified, or otherwise creates a danger zone within a 5 ft. radius of its space where it lands; anyone who begins their turn or enters the area takes half damage.

- Bolas Arrow (Bowkind T1): Taser Arrow, but the abilitech Prones the target instead. When knocked prone in this way, the target must also use a minor action, or use their full speed instead of half, to get up.

- Dual Bolas (T2): Hit two targets within 10 feet of each other and knock them both prone, neither can move until both targets are up. An object can be substituted in place of a creature but the object will not be knocked prone.

Pyrokinesis

- Accelerant (T1): Ash Cloud (lesser), but it instead douses the air with accelerants for 1 minute. Any creatures that move into this terrain are doused with them even if they move out; the accelerants impose Lethal (2P) and extend any condition inflicted by a Pyrokinesis subpower by 1 round.
- Fire Lash (T1): Spend a lesser slot when grappling as a major action to inflict Pd3+PCM damage on a successful grapple. They can then repeat this as a minor action without slot cost on subsequent turns to repeat the damage automatically as long as the grapple lasts.

- Midnight Candle (T1): You Ignite (at-will) yourself instead, but Flame instead damages all other targets within range when it would damage you.

- Crunch of Glass: Your critical hits against Shatterpoints trade out Daze for Impair for the same duration.
- Shattered Bones: Inflict Lethal (Lvl) on any attacks landed against Shatterpoints.

- Overwhelming Force: When you land attacks against the Vitals and it would cause the target to have more than two instances of Daze at once, raise the crit range and damage size by +1 per additional instance of Daze.

The Abilitech/Subpower Tweaks tag denotes items and effects that modify an existing specibus and/or power.

- Heavy Mode/Overtuned (T1): The specibus/focus has +1 die size on all damage rolls, but if the attack roll has any Block dice, it gains an additional die of the highest one.
- Life on the Edge (T1): Whenever this specibus or focus inflicts Rupture, it also inflicts Lethal of the same magnitude.
- Hair Trigger (T2): Once per strife, when you miss a target with your attack roll, you may choose not to make the attack, refunding the action that would've been used to make it, but you cannot make another damage-dealing action with this refunded action. No resources are spent on the action, and any abilities that would've been wasted on the failed attack roll (such as Enhance! or Hold Breath) carry over to your next attack roll.
- Skill Issue (T2): Once per strife, when you make a skill check during a strife and it fails to beat another skill check or a resistance, you may choose to forego the action, refunding the action cost, but you cannot reattempt another skill check with that refunded action. No resources are spent on the action, and any abilities that would've been wasted on the failed attack roll (such as Heroic Pose or As a Team!) carry over to your next skill check.
- Pinning Charge (Dive, Flying Kick, Haymaker T1): These abilitechs also impose a condition for 1 round. Pick any one condition the specibus is capable of inflicting, or Clipped, or Impaired.

- Pressed Assault (T1): Your next abilitech has either +2 die sizes or extends its conditions' duration by 1 round.

- Buzzsaw (Spree, Hack and Slash, Reap, Charge, Roadkill T1): These abilitechs instead make two attacks at disadvantage against each target instead. If both against a target hit, you make a third that automatically hits for half damage.

- Circular Momentum (T1): You may harness the momentum on your following turn; either your next melee attack may hit all targets within range, or you may move half your base speed as a free action.

- Extra Ordinance 1 (Bombkind T1): When using a Bombkind abilitech, you can decrease cache by 1 to make it hit all targets within 10 feet (or increase radius by 10 feet), extend the duration of its condition by 1 round (or environmental effect for 1 minute), or add +1 die size to damage.
- Extra Ordnance 2 (Bombkind T1): When using a Bombkind abilitech, you can decrease cache by 1 to deal half damage on miss, push all targets 20 feet, Impair all targets in the environmental effect, or deal +50% damage on a crit.
- Auld Lang Syne (Fncysntakind T1): If you use Letters to Santa while you already have three charges, the spirit of Christmas is so overwhelming that you cause an explosion centered on yourself, dealing Qd3+STR damage to all targets within 15 feet and Q damage to yourself.

- Overflowing Cheer (T1): Track excess charges. If you get four excess charges, you immediately use an abilitech that expends 3 charges for half damage as part of the same minor action, then take half again damage to yourself, and go to 3 charges and no excess.

The Defensive tag denotes items and effects that provides defensive, protective, and other harm reduction effects.

- Deployable Shield (T1): A device that extends into a standing shield that can be used as a 10 ft. long piece of half cover for +2 to AC/Reflex. Alternately, it serves as a fully-covered, transparent wall up to 10 feet long.

- Higher Tiers: The shield also grants Aegis, can move with the player, can be detonated as a trap that damages enemies and lets players fly away from the momentum.

- Ice Block (Cryokinesis T1): When you would hit 0 HP, you instead go to 1 HP and encase yourself in ice, putting yourself in Stasis until the ice block around you is broken, 1 hour passes, or until you come out as a free action. This can be done once per long rest, but can be refreshed earlier with two lesser slots as a full-round action. The ice block has AC/resistances of 10 and 50 HP.
- Holistic Infusion (Radiokinesis T1): When you hit 0 HP, you then immediately heal for Pd6+PCM hit points and return to the fight. This can be done once per long rest, but can be refreshed earlier with two lesser slots as a full-round action.

##### Friendly Utility

The Friendly Utility tag denotes items and effects that grants combat benefits to the player or their allies.

RPGStuck Gift Shop

Alchemy that brings back mechanics from Second Edition, for good or for ill. Probably for ill, since rpgstuck-chan gets paid by commission.

- RPGStuck Gift Shop Memento: Fusilier (T1): You have three Cartridges that replenish on a short rest. You may expend one to perform one of the following as a free action:

- Blast Shot: Your next ranged attack knocks the target Prone.
- Clipping Shot: Your missed ranged attack still deals any bonus damage (anything besides the base damage roll before stat mods) that the attack would've landed if it hit.
- Show of Force: Your ranged attack deals no damage but it targets Will resistance instead. If it breaks resistance, the target is Exposed until the end of your next turn. Either way, for the same duration, they are also Clipped and you have advantage on your ranged attack rolls against them.

##### Path Tweaks

The Path Tweaks tag denotes items and effects that modify Steps for a player.

Battlemind

- Greater Mind Shield (T1): Mind Shield can be used twice per round and can be used for allies within 100 feet as well.
- Greater Mental Shackles (T1): Mental Shackles can either increase Setback's magnitude by 1, or inflict Weaken instead of Setback.

- Make an attack (using your stats) against AC for Pd3+PCM damage.
- When you land a single-target attack, deal an additional Pd3 damage.

- You can dissemble the construct as a minor action, with any HP refunded to your ward. While active, your construct counts as your ward for the purposes of Steps and other synergies (such as Mind Spike), and you can draw your block radius from the ward.

- The Shaper (T2): When you summon your construct, you can have it take a certain shape. You can change its shape as a minor action.

Half-trace works the same as trace, but two targets may be half-traced at once, your next successful attack against a half-traced target deals 50% bonus damage rather than 100%, and everything that specifies a traced target (Trigonometry, Vital-Point Targeting, etc) works on both targets.

At the end of each tethered creature's turn, if this condition is unmet, both of them take Pd3+PCM damage. You may tether one end to an object, an ally, or yourself; in this case, only the other target takes this damage when the condition is unmet (initiative 0 for objects).

You can undo this max HP reduction after a rest, though you can't reduce your max HP multiple times for multiple die sizes.

- Stormwracked Sworn (Thaumaturge T1): Eldritch Blast and any Step or alchemy effect that involves rolling anything besides an attack roll or skill check gains +1 size to that roll when at half HP or less.

- Warmed by Hate Alone (T1): When you expend a Dream, pick two negative conditions; you ignore them for 1 round.
- Purgation (T1): Expend a Dream as a free action to create a 30 ft. radius sphere of fire centered on yourself for 1 minute; all enemies of your choice within it count this as difficult terrain, and take P damage if they start their turn or enter the area. This counts as an abilitech and subpower for the purposes of synergy with other Steps and effects.
- Our Lady of Cleansing Flame (T1): Once per strife, when you are critically hit or would be reduced to 0 HP, resolve it; you regain 1 HP and one Dream afterwards.

- Seasons of the Valley (Harmony): Every strife, you have Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. You may activate one season at the start of each round, and it lasts for that round. After a short rest, you may choose a specific season; this chosen season has additional effects when used.

- Spring: You gain 3P temporary hit points.
- Summer: When an enemy lands an attack on you, deal Pd2 damage to them. This damage counts as an abilitech/subpower for synergy.
- Autumn: You gain +3 to all resistances and opposed skill checks.
- Winter: All enemies within the strife count as having Rupture (P) that stacks with itself from other sources.

- Season of Desolation (T1): If you start a round without any Seasons to use, you gain a rising +1 hit/crit/AC/resist that stacks to +3.
- Season of Salvation (T1): If you or an ally is critically hit or reduced to 0 HP, you may expend a Season to grant them 3P hit points or temp HP (your choice).
- Season of Renewal (T1): Whenever you spend 5 BP, you may regain use of one Season.

- Princeps of Deceit (Protagonist T1): Whenever you use Heroic Pose as a major action, you may turn Invisible for 1 round. Alternately, an ally becomes Invisible for 1 round, or an enemy becomes Exposed until the end of your next turn. If used as a full-round action, pick any two.
- Shonen Protagonist (Protagonist T1): Whenever you use LP, you also gain +1 to AC/resistances for the rest of the strife. You can only gain this +1 once per round, but it stacks three times, to +3.
- Shifting Gear (Seraph T1): As a free action, you may Shift Gears; for 5 rounds, you have +1 die size to all damage, +2 crit range, and +10 ft. to your base speed. You are also Ruptured (P) and all attacks against you have +3 to crit range for the duration.
- Cruise Control (Seraph T1): As a free action, you may turn on Cruise Control; for 5 rounds, you may Defend as a minor action and gain an extra minor action each turn that may only be used to Avert, Discern, or Defend. You also have halved base speed, -3 to crit range, and -1 die size to all damage for the duration.

#### Higher Tier Preset Alchemies

For players who want to start at higher levels, they'll also want to start with alchemized gear to compensate.

We recommend starting them off at the first level of whichever tier of play they want to start in, and giving them a full complement of alchemy from the preceding tier. For example, players who want to start at level 5 at Tier 2 should have alchemy from Tier 1, just as they would have if they started at level 1 and got to level 5.

##### Level 5 Start (Tier 2)

Players starting at level 5 will have two Steps and their level 5 specialization. It's also entirely possible they have the max of 20 in a stat of their choosing.

We recommend the following alchemized gear for them:

Specibus/Focus:

- Weathered Tool: You may reroll 1s on your damage roll. If you can already do this, you instead add +1 to each die instead.

Wardrobe:

- Saving Grace: Once per short rest, when you are critically hit or reduced to 0 hit points, you heal for Pd4 hit points after calculating and taking damage, but before you would pass out, die, or whatever the narration dictates.

Accessories:

- Packed Lunch: Whenever you heal from rolling hit dice, you add +1 to each die.
- Sharp Crystal: Whenever you can claim flat hit bonuses on an attack roll, you also have +1 to crit for every +2 to hit.

The following start will fit most needs for alchemy for someone starting Tier 2. However, we recommend talking with your player and switching them out for more specific items to suit their build. For example, the following might be the starting alchemy for a T2 player with scythekind and Steps from Dancer.

Specibus/Focus:

- Harvest Moon (Buzzsaw): Reap makes two attacks at disadvantage against each target instead. If both against a target hit, you make a third that automatically hits for half damage.

Wardrobe:

- Aesthete's Veil (Khachaturian's Encore): For each Step in Dancer, gain 2 Dancer Points (DP) that regen on a short rest. Provocative Dance and Marin Karin cost 2 DP, while Feign Surrender, Wait Your Turn, and All Eyes on Me cost 1 DP. These Steps then lose their rest/strife-limited uses.

- You can Flourish as a major action to pose dramatically and gain 2 DP, but any DP gained this way are lost at the end of the strife. They then gain one of the following:
- Whenever you spend DP in a strife, all enemies in the strife gain Lethal (P) per 1 DP spent, stacking up to Lethal (6P).

Accessories:

- Butterfly Charm (Improvisation): Once per strife, when you spend DP but fail to break resistance with the action that spent it (does not apply to All Eyes on Me or any DP move that doesn't target a resistance), you refund the DP cost. Alternately, you may spend 1 DP to reroll the check.
- Silver Skull Keychain (Buzzsaw Extra): After using Reap, you may harness the momentum on your following turn; either your next melee attack may hit all targets within range, or you may move half your base speed as a free action.

##### Scenariostuck Premades

Alchemy premade for 3e Scenariostuck since removed in favor of a simpler, uniform progression are listed here, split into tier 1 and tier 2.

However, keep in mind that Scenariostuck balanced its alchemy differently; it chose one item from the list to use as an accessory, but did not have separate effects for specibus/focus and wardrobe. Each effect in the list has as much power as a specibus/focus effect, wardrobe effect, and accessory effect combined, for that given tier.

Tier 1:

- Tojo Clan Pin (grapplers): Any targets you grapple are considered Ruptured (2, duration of grapple). When you use any abilities that need a grappled target, or calls for an Athletics check, add 3 damage to any damage it deals. If they deal no damage, they Daze (1 round) instead.

- Sekhmet's Intonation (heavy-hitting bruisers): At the start of a strife, add up your skill points in any two of Athletics, Endurance, psi skill, and Intimidation; you have this as temp HP that stacks with other temp HP.

- Echo Edge (combo attackers): At the end of each turn, gain 3 points per damaging attack you landed that turn, up to 9 points per turn. You can turn these points to temp HP that lasts 1 round or a damage bonus to your next two attacks, dividing between the two as you wish.

You add 1 to this gauge whenever you pass a skill check or each time your STR or DEX mods are invoked when using a Step. You add 2 instead if you passed a Strength or Dexterity skill check. When the meter is full, you can reset it as a free action to make your next landed attack deal +100% damage.

- Knight's Gunblade Polish (martial hybrids): Whenever you land a damaging abilitech or subpower, make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill check, skill of your choosing; if this roll would also hit, the damage roll gains +1 die size and extend the duration of any conditions inflicted by 1 round. If the check would miss, you must choose which one of the two effects you apply.
- Disarticulate's Butter Knife (psi hybrids): Whenever you use an abilitech against a target with one or more conditions you inflicted, or conditions that expired on your turn, you can roll and treat it as if it were a psionic attack, and gain +2 to hit for each such condition (up to +6).

It has a range of 5 feet, has 40 ft. speed, and +5 for any skill checks.

The Invisibility lasts until you use a damaging ability or the end of your next turn, and said damaging ability has +1 die size. You may do this as a reaction to a damaging attack; doing so also halves the damage of the triggering attack.

- Ivory Chess Piece (psi sentinels): Whenever you expend a lesser slot, all enemies in the strife take 10 true damage and any two of the following: Weakened (1 round), Dazed (1 round), Impaired (1 round), Prone, Stasis (2 rounds), Sundered (1, stacks to 4), Faded (1, stacks to 4).
