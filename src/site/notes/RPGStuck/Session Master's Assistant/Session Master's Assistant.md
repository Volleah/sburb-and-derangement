### ==> Chapter 0: Introduction

“Welcome to the thunderdome.”

Welcome to the RPGStuck Session Master’s Assistant! We hope you have fun as a Session Master (SM) in the RPGStuck system, and we hope that together with your players you are able to tell exciting stories and embark on great adventures! This book assumes that you know the basics on how to use the RPGStuck rule system.

If you would like to read the rules and mechanics for RPGStuck, please check out the [Directory](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vzUpuu7YcN0_vJasWXIvn_lNQCHMQf17waUlYTAXUBM/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040106888&usg=AOvVaw29TeuTIZEgZTjsWFgFkIcu) for a list of documents in our system.

#### Outline

There are several chapters to this document, each going over a different aspect of how to effectively SM.

- Chapter 1: The Players

- First and foremost, you are creating a world for your players. But you need to first understand what your players are like.

- Chapter 2: Worldbuilding

- You then need to go about actually creating this world and filling it.

- Chapter 3: Adventure Design

- You have a world, and you have players for it. In practice, just letting them loose often leads to aimless wandering and a sense of being lost. Therefore, you’ll need to know how to go about directing their adventure.

- Chapter 4: Skills and Gambits

- Your players want to perform an action, using the skills their character has. When should you ask them to roll, and what exactly is a skill anyway?

- Chapter 5: Classpects and God Tiers

- Your players need mythological roles. How do you even go about that anyway?

- Chapter 6: Prototypings and Modifications

- Your players prototyped some inane items, or you want to spice things up. How does that work?

- Chapter 7: Alchemy

- Your players want to alchemize stuff. What do they make?

#### Being an SM

Are You Sure?

Being a Session Master (alternate names such as Sburb Master or Skaian Maestro is equally acceptable) is both a blessing and a curse, endowed with great creative power but also great responsibility. You are the creative force behind the game, writing and directing the story, as well as your players’ parts in it.

RPGStuck is also played by play by post (PbP) for the most part, which means it takes place over a text medium than in person or in a voice call. For those that have SMed more traditional tabletops before, expect about the same amount of effort, just more spread out.

Being an SM is a significant commitment over a long period of time, and should not be taken lightly. Past experience shows a session takes on rough average, a year and half to complete, with not enough completed sessions to be more precise. Since PbP is more frequently involved (a good rule of thumb is that players and SMs share at least one exchange per day), the risk of burnout for you as the SM is higher.

Therefore, we would recommend that you pace yourself, and you remain aware of the risk of burnout. These sessions take place over long stretches of time, so you are better served by taking your time and going more slowly, or taking time off, if need be. The session relies on you to SM it, which means your mental health is of the utmost priority. The point of games is to have fun. If you as the SM aren’t having fun, then neither will the players.

Principles and Practices

There’s some guiding principles to keep in mind as you go ahead with your SMing.

- Be a fan of your players. Sburb isn’t the easiest game to play, so your players will have enough stacked against them as is. Be interested in who they are and excited for their deeds.
- Foster trust between yourself and your players. This is not the sort of game where an SM vs players mentality works out, not to mention, would you want to SM players that are against you? Or play under an SM that’s against you? Be supportive of the players, but have integrity in how you do things.
- Avoid saying no. Players don’t enjoy being told they can’t do something. Instead, explain why they can’t do something, and offer alternatives, or ask them what they were planning. This helps keep the game going by spurring the players to further planning, or action.

- That said, be firm with yourself. Try to set a schedule for how often you update (or doot as we say here) your players, and stick to it. Consistency is key.

- Make sure your players know each other! RPGStuck, like other tabletops, is a social game. Each session in canon knew each other, and so should your players.
- Never be afraid to ask for help. If you’re reading this, odds are you’re part of the RPGStuck community. It’s full of other SMs who’d love to give you advice from their own experiences with the system! If you feel like you don’t understand something, ask someone!

### ==> Chapter 1: The Players

"A SM without players is like a car without tires."

#### Gathering your Players

Setting Expectations

As an SM, figure out what you want. What sort of SM are you? Do you like leaning heavily into worldbuilding? Or character interaction? Maybe complex combats or brain-busting puzzles are more your jam. Do you have specific conceits, gimmicks, or other canon-altering ideas in mind that you want to implement?

And what about the tone? Are you looking to run something serious? Or something memetic. Maybe you have a particular theme in mind and you’d request the players stick to it.

And what about consequences? Player death is left to you, the SM, as a tool to use in your narrative. Do you have a realistic, gritty session in mind where death is a real risk in every strife? Something else in mind that eschews death for your own, more creative fates? Or something esoteric or otherwise specific in mind?

Figured something out? Now say so in the signup post. Explain to the potential players signing up right off the bat. Yes, it might spoil your session to a minor degree, and there’s the chance your tastes change as you run the session. But tabletop games are cooperative experiences, and it’s best to set the record straight from the beginning.

Know Your Players

Every player is different. As an SM, it’s your job to keep the session entertaining for them.

- Some players like roleplaying. They enjoy interacting with NPCs, or they enjoy detailing their character’s thoughts and actions. These players prefer depth to their stories and characters, reading into them deeply, and value the plot highly.
- Some players enjoy exploring and problem solving. They like discovering, cataloguing, and shaping their world. These players appreciate detailed worldbuilding.
- Some players enjoy fighting and number crunching. They like seeing the numbers add up, and they like the turn-based combat. These players appreciate intricate, dynamic strifes and fulfilling mechanics.

Additionally, each character has a background and personality. Read into them, use it to determine their classpect, land, and running themes, and figure out what makes their character tick. Keep in mind, however, that many characters are prone to changing due to the world-shattering nature of the entry process and Sburb itself.

Furthermore, your players don’t exist in a vacuum. It’s highly likely some of them will know each other from elsewhere. Ask them who they like and they don’t like. If your players already play well together, you can use that. And if they don’t, then you know you need to account for that when picking them.

Lines and Veils

Something to talk about with your players after choosing them, and gathering together to set up the initial parameters of the session.

Lines are topics the session doesn’t bring up. For example, someone with an aversion to needles can ask that it isn’t brought up. Romance is sometimes a line, out of discomfort at roleplaying it, those that are disinterested or aromantic, or a hundred other reasons. It doesn’t matter what the reason for it is; if someone is uncomfortable with a topic, the game does not touch the topic.

Veils are similar, being topics that are skipped over, such as the common fade to black. These are skipped over for the benefit of all those involved, though like lines, disinterest can be enough of a reason. These topics can still be mentioned and happen in the game, but they should never be depicted.

Troubleshooting

RPGStuck, like any other tabletop, can be prone to the same player issues. Sometimes the player is busy or loses interest and has to slow down or even step out entirely, sometimes they roleplay their characters onto a path they, you, or other players don’t enjoy, and occasionally the player is toxic and a detriment to the session.

- If the player becomes busy in real life and is unable to keep up, it’s by no means a rare occurrence; sessions take a rough average of a year and a half to complete, and real life can change drastically in that time.

- Immediately separate them from other players such that they won’t be slowed down by them as well.
- If possible, figure out something the player can be doing off-screen, so to speak. Something with which the player’s character can be said to have been doing for the duration of their absence.
- Discuss plans to catch them up at some later point in time by some means, or rewrite their plot arc to better fit their reduced time.

- If the player roleplays themselves into a corner, it is less frequent, but not unfamiliar. This happens often with new players, or players trying out a new character archetype.

- Work with the player out of character to figure out an in-universe friendly way to rerail their character progression in a way you and they agree on.
- If this behavior is how the player wanted to do it, but you or other players have an issue with it, sit them down and talk it over with them. This is unsettling to the other parties, and needs to be clamped down on.

- If the player is an outright menace or otherwise highly illogical in how their character is acting, in or out of character, there’s ways to deal with that.

- Be firmly against it, and upfront in the opposition. State what is wrong, and what needs to change immediately, clearly, and with no indecisive language. Work with them to fix the problem.
- If they refuse to change their ways, kick them from the session. If they refuse to work with you, they have forced your hand, and an immediate kick is the only option left.

"You like the world, huh? Name every river."

#### Land Design

Guidelines

The minutiae of geographical land design is beyond the bounds of this document, doubly so when Sburb needs not follow real life laws of nature. Instead, here are some guidelines to keep in mind when making each Land.

- The player’s starting area, and the four odd-numbered gates that send the player to another part of their land. This means five distinct zones upon which to focus; the five should likely share some themes common to the Land, but otherwise can be radically different.
- Combat, stealth, diplomacy, and exploration. Many playstyles can be summarized as a blend of these four. Plan accordingly.
- Mechanically, play to the character’s strengths. Roleplay-wise, this rule need not apply, based on how your NPCs and Quest is designed. More on that further below.
- Assign rough levels for each zone to get a feel for how long a player would spend in there. This will let you estimate how long or short the player’s arcs and wanderings should be.
- Think about NPCs. As a rule of thumb, one or two new friendly NPCs per zone is enough.
- Antagonists on the land are hard, but not impossible. Traditional underlings can’t speak like sentient creatures, which poses difficulty when using them in any diplomatic sense. Figure something out that works for you.

- On this note, also come up with an antagonist or goal for each zone. This will aid you when making the Quest.

- Ramp up gradually; do not throw the entire splendor of the land or anything marvelous at the beginning. Players typically expect escalation the further in they go, not for it all to be burst upon them at the start. The latter is a factor in players growing bored during the latter half of the session, after the midgame’s climaxes but before the endgame.
- Each zone should feel fresh. Avoid making each zone “like the last zone, but it also has X.”

#### NPC Design

What Do You Do Here?

Think of the purpose that a given NPC serves. What do they do in the story as relevant to the player’s journey?

- Exposition. Sprites are a clear example of this.
- Herald/quest-giver to direct the player. Sprites can also do this.
- They provide a service.

- For another NPC. Carapacians to their king, for example.
- For the player. Friendly consorts.
- For the antagonist(s). Minions, but more than faceless goons.

- They make the player feel good about themselves.
- They have their own motives.

- Consider how the player works into these motives, or how they don’t.
- Is what they want beneficial to the player’s goals? Or detrimental? Or perhaps it’s irrelevant?
- Would they be antagonistic to any other NPC? Any in particular?
- If they die, do their goals die with them?

- The setting mandates their existence. Sprites also fill this.
- As an antagonist.

What Do You Want?

Think of an NPC’s motivation. What do they want? As per Vonnegut, every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water. Sometimes, you may find that they have everything they want, in which case a popular answer is they want everything to stay the same. This answer is incredibly common in real life.

Personally….

What is the NPC like? What’s their personality? Flavorless, bland NPCs have a place when extra bodies are needed; the spear carriers, of sorts. However, those don’t require much of a guide to utilize, whereas creating nuanced characters may.

- A typing quirk or distinct way of speaking is a large factor in how a player responds to an NPC.
- Mechanically, if they have a disposition or an inverse, they will likely reflect it in their mindsets to some degree.
- When creating several NPCs, use common groupings to differentiate them. The [Four Temperament Ensemble](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040174061&usg=AOvVaw1yaMDWnD1M4qfoHyXc9ue9), the [Myers Briggs personality types](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp%3D1&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040174651&usg=AOvVaw2PGNJ5Xrk7z1x-yZGwwv4M), or even the Zodiac (of Western, Eastern, or Extended flavors) are widely used for a reason.
- Make nuances and details within the characters after the broad strokes are in place.
- Ask, “How and why do they do X?” when determining if a character is ready.

Change and Development

How can the NPC develop throughout the story? What makes a person change?

Well firstly, let’s ask why an NPC might need to change. They change as the story progresses and events influence them. Often, the players may latch onto what were intended to be temporary characters, and what little was written for them to cover their temporary use needs to be expanded.

- Overcoming skill or moral flaws within themselves.
- Consistent unpredictability.

- Contradiction between words and deeds. Do as they say, not as they do.
- Treatment of people. People don’t treat their mothers the same as they would their child, and both different from a coworker, a client, or a stranger.
- Throw them into new and unexpected situations. For example, what if they’re at a restaurant and they don’t have their wallet?

- Achieving their goals.

- Are they corruptible? Power and money have ways of changing people.
- They achieve their life’s dream. What now?

- How set are they in their ways to begin with?

- Planescape would answer that regret can change the nature of a man.
- Younger characters tend to change more than the elderly.
- Sometimes, the character isn’t easily changed, and this immutability is a core tenet of their character.

Pitfalls to Avoid

There are mistakes commonly made in RPGStuck relating to SMs and creating NPCs.

- Make everything related to a theme. Not everything about a character must wind back to a central concept.
- Something cool or badass about a character should not be the only facet to their character, give them more. The same goes for expository NPCs; if they only exist to give information, why not move that role to another, fleshed out NPC?

- Then again, sometimes an NPC doesn’t need to, which leads into the next point.

- Not every single NPC needs to be fleshed out with a comprehensive backstory and psychological breakdown.

- Part of being a good SM is recognizing what characters do and don’t need to be detailed, and saving themselves said effort.
- If the NPC’s main purpose is cannon fodder, they don’t quite need a fleshed out personality. Not when they’re not really going to use it. If they live past their expected expiration, expound on them then, not before.

- God NPCs are a type of character that make the player irrelevant because they eliminate any challenge for the player. Remember, it is the player’s story, not the NPC’s. The NPCs are a supporting cast, and should be treated as such. Write accordingly.
- They should be consistent. Make a short list of core ideas or what an NPC would do, and follow it when unsure.

- “I have no idea what to do.” is a valid response, both in-universe and in real life. But use this in moderation.

- Make do with less. You only have so much screentime you can spare for a given NPC, and this time goes down the more NPCs you need to show. If you can reduce the number of NPCs, do so. If you start being crunched for NPCs, you can always introduce more later into the story.
- Show, don’t tell. An out of universe explanation of a character, short of something meant to remedy disruption and friction in the player’s thread or session group, such as a warning to stop killing NPCs wantonly, should not be accepted as good exposition.

- On that note, don’t talk up an NPC’s abilities. One bad string of dice rolls can easily curtail whatever potential they were expected to live up to.

- Child NPCs engender a desire to protect with incredible ease and rapidity. Use them cautiously.

#### Moon Design

Everyone that has read Homestuck knows the basics; there is a king and a queen of each moon, there are two moons that are at war with each other, and Derse is destined to win over Prospit. But let’s take the broad strokes into something actually usable.

What do They Do?

Canon is a reason for them to exist, but you as an SM probably need more than that. You need something to do with them.

- The dreamself. Every player typically has one, barring horrible or temporal (hilarity optional) shenanigans. The dreamself, technically, does not have weapons, though SMs can and do allow them to share weapons or give other means of arming themselves, depending on what they have planned.

- The dreamself is the non-combat portion of the session, and a major part of the overall scheme of things. Between a dreamself’s reverence from the carapacians and their ability to fly, diplomacy and discovery easily come front and center.

- The Reckoning, at the canon endgame. Endgames don’t just happen, there’s setup and foreshadowing long before the players get there. The dream moons, being the homes of the factions involved in it, easily serve as locales in which said setup can be shown to and influenced by the players.

- If you have another endgame planned, change the moons to setup and foreshadow that instead, in some way. Derse dreamers can look into the Furthest Ring, and Prospit dreamers have visions in the clouds. Both of these are straightforward ways to disseminate info to the player they wouldn’t otherwise have.

- Access to the carapacian NPCs. Treat the moons just as you would a Land for the purpose of being a hub in which NPCs can hang around, ply their trade, and go about their business while being open for interaction.
- The queens of the kingdoms typically stay on their moons, and they carry the rings. Powerful NPCs, sometimes available from the very beginning.

Plan for the Players

The players can fly. This sole fact gives them a ridiculous amount of freedom in where they can go, so plan accordingly. They can go just about anywhere, and players, being players in a tabletop game, will end up in places you didn’t intend for them to be.

Other than that? Plan for them as you would if they were anywhere else.

Organization and Bureaucracy

All kingdoms have some sort of hierarchy; someone has to tell the peasants what to do, the soldiers where to go, and the dreamselves what mandatory and silly rules they should follow. This is also a convenient way to go about making NPCs, and also a way to show off the character of a moon.

Ask yourself; if something on a moon needs to be done, who goes and does it?

- A single, overworked bureaucrat. This has some grounding in canon. Even without repeating what Jack did, a government worker who understands the system is a dangerous opponent and a useful ally.
- Emissaries and diplomats. The king and queen can’t speak to everyone at all times. They can be anything from glorified messengers to political forces in their own right.
- Generals, marshals, khans, strategoi. What have you. The military brass. This one should be obvious.
- Stewards, trade secretaries, master of coin. They keep the money flowing, and the economy afloat. For how effective a coin counter can be, look no further than Littlefinger from Game of Thrones.
- Spymaster. Intelligence gathering, espionage, cloak and dagger, wetwork. This one should be easy to extrapolate.
- Heir to the throne. This one’s rare, and not canon, but it’s been done before. Succession crises are, in fiction and in history, wonderful sources of chaos and new plotlines.
- Spiritual authority. Also seldom seen, but a more philosophically minded mentor of some sort can help players decipher prophecies, learn more about their session, and muse on the more esoteric aspects of Sburb.
- Scientific authority. Chief ectobiologist, doomsday weapons creator, any sort of role that can be filled by the smart one of the cast, which makes it versatile.
- Nobles. Seldom to sometimes seen, canon unconfirmed. A feudal kingdom has lesser nobles to whom land management is delegated. If the monarchy is a bit more absolute, replace with politicians, like a House of Commons, or bureaucrats, as the Chinese did, or whatever else works for the moon you have in mind.
- Figures of interest. Advisors, traders, personal servants, people with reason to be spoken to on kingdom business.

When you’ve compiled your list, go over it. And then begin cutting. Look at each NPC again, and ask yourself if their role can be better done by someone else. It’s not as though you will only have this cast; more can appear as the session goes on should you desire it.

#### Tying it all Together

Sticking to Canon

Obviously, this is a tabletop game based on Homestuck, and thus should stick to the canon when reasonable. However, past experience has shown what does and does not work.

- The entry process is almost always stuck to, though it’s a process with many steps.

Said steps have been reproduced as a checklist for easy tracking. In previous editions, it's been tradition to reward players with a level for seeing this through, which continues to 3e. Give them 30 XP for getting all this done. More if unforeseen shenanigans occurred during it, which given the nature of the setting, shouldn't be ruled out.

- Deployed the Cruxtruder
- Deployed the Totem Lathe
- Deployed the Alchemiter
- Deployed the Punched Card
- Opened the Cruxtruder
- Prototyped the Kernelsprite
- Carved the Cruxite Dowel
- Created the Entry Item
- Solved the entry puzzle
- Level up Client PC

- The Seven Gates do not follow canon in most actual sessions; the layout of these gates makes it difficult to impossible for a player to return home. For simplicity’s sake, most sessions instead have each odd-numbered gate go to a locale on their own land. The even-numbered gates still retain their function of sending the player to their server’s house, but they are located above the player’s house like the odd-numbered gates, instead of in the area to which the odd-numbered gates lead. Return nodes exist for both such that the player can go both ways without much hassle.
- Ectobiology, ensuring the players’ origins and sending them back through the meteors or some other method, is dependent on the SM. More sessions lean towards including it than excluding it, though the choice is left up to the SM, based on the particulars of their session.
- The Genesis Frog, as of February 5th, 2019, is not a topic many RPGStuck sessions have gotten far enough to handle, and not enough information exists on its creation in practice upon which generalizations can be made.

Sometimes, if you don’t enjoy an aspect of canon, or you’ve been around the block and want something novel, you can disregard canon if you so wish. However, there are two major factors to consider when deviating from canon.

- Is this what the players want? If you want to deviate from canon in a major way, it should be stated as such at the beginning, as explained in Setting Expectations.
- Are you fine with explaining every bit of the deviation as it becomes necessary? Canon gives expectations that your players can expect, that you play off of.

- For example, while in-character the players may not know what an alchemiter or grist initially is, out of character everyone knows what they are. This isn’t something you have to explain to them.

- A deviancy has no such benefits. You cannot expect them to read your mind; you will have to explain everything to them.

- Experience has shown that players tend to gloss over such in-character discoveries, specifically because out of character they already know it. They'll react to it in-character, but they don't want to spend a real life month over it.
- Every part of the session that doesn’t match canon creates more uncertainty, which influences a player’s actions.

Keeping Track

Once you have everything ready, it needs to be tracked. For NPCs, they need to be catalogued, their associated player noted, and simple but distinguishing facts like appearance, quirk, and disposition noted. For NPCs with a greater hand in things, keep track of their motivations and what they aim to do; motivations can change as the session does.

Session Length

This is an important part of the session, important enough that you MUST answer this before you actually start the session:

How long do you actually want to run this game?

An unfinished session is a tragedy for all involved. You should think about the long term when you do this.

There are five session lengths, corresponding to each of the five tiers of levels. E.g. Length 3 means the session expects to end around when the players finish tier 3, or level 13. This also affects everything else, such as pacing, story content, etc, so give this some considerable thought.

Developer’s Note (3/15/20): For the 2e veterans, we’d estimate that one tier of play in 3e is equivalent to about 9 levels from 2e, maybe a few more or few less.

Furthermore, going by historically finished sessions, we’d peg the average session length as length 2 or length 3.

### ==> Chapter 3: Adventure Design

"You are the [noun] in this [adjective] land, and you must save the [macguffin]!"

#### Quest Design

What is the Point?

Think about the point of the Quest in canon.

- Is it meant to help the player grow?

- Does it reinforce or nurture their positive qualities?
- Does it make them confront their negative aspects?
- Does it shape their development towards a certain end?

- Is it meant to achieve an objective?

- What is the point of this objective?
- Who benefits, and who loses, if any? Why?
- Why hasn’t someone else done it first?
- What makes the player special that only they can do it?

Why Should the Player Care?

Out of character, we know to go with Quests because it’s part of the session. In-character, the players need some sort of reason. Remember: The session is about the player. Not an NPC. The Quest should be such that it doesn’t work if the player doesn’t pursue it.

- What draws them to do it?
- Or what prevents them from not doing it? What forces their hand?
- How do they learn of this quest and how to go about it at every step?

How does it Relate to Them?

The Quest should relate to the player in some way, thematic to some aspect of that character.

- Does it go off their motivations?

- What does the player want, and will this give it to them?
- Or does the player know what they don’t want, and this aids them in that?
- Does it give them something else entirely, out of left field?

- Does it relate to their personality?

- A popular one in practice with some backing in canon, does it challenge who they are as a person?
- Or does it fill in less developed aspects to their character?

- Maybe it relates to their interests?
- Does it make them develop?

- And not in a way covered by the first three?

Actual Structuring

We’ve talked about all the thought that goes into a quest, now let’s design one.

- There are five distinct zones, at the least. The player’s starting area with their house, the first, third, and fifth gates, and their seventh gate with their Denizen. Use this as a skeleton for planning.

- Five room dungeon? The threshold, puzzle, conflict, setback, and climax.
- Five act media. Shakespeare, Homestuck up to [S] Cascade, book series, television, anything that comes to mind. If nothing in media can truly be original, then anything and everything is up for grabs.

- Figure out how your NPCs fit into this.

- If they don’t, consider scrapping them or consolidating their role into another NPC.
- Consider what changes if a given NPC is removed, which can happen often given the chaotic nature of Sburb.
- Figure out who is absolutely critical to the Quest. If they cannot be made non-essential, protect them fiercely.

- Figure out how the player fits into this.

- If you can’t figure out what the player should do, how can they?
- Is what they do fallible? Does it come with a hard failure state? A soft one that just makes others harder, or works in degrees? Or can they just keep trying till they get it?
- Don’t try to anticipate everything a player can do. Create a central idea or frame from which you can improvise. Plan for obvious divergences, such as if a player chooses path A or path B.
- How does the Denizen and their Choice come into play here, if they do at all?

- Partition the Quest.

- Ask yourself, “What stops the player from circumventing the Quest’s steps in some way? Through the aid of their dream kingdom, or alternate timeline selves, through heavy use of time travel, or ridiculous amounts of alchemy?”
- A Quest should not be something that is done with quickly. The completion of one’s Quest is one of the indicators that the session is closing towards the endgame.

What is a Quest, Actually?

Now that you have an idea of the flavor and in-character happenings of the Quest, let’s get deeper into it.

- What is the goal of the quest? More than one can apply here.

- The self. Power, knowledge, change, etc.
- Others. Another NPC, another player, someone from the player’s backstory.
- Nature, or a force. Paradox Space, their aspect, something that clearly acts and can be acted upon, but doesn’t fit the two above.
- An idea. Learning it, knowing it, discovering it, destroying it, saving it.

- Determine the method by which the Quest is done.

- Break, Sneak, Parley, Trick, Navigate, Endure, Channel, Exploit, Find, Unlock, from the obstacle/puzzle design later in this document. Actions the player must take to progress on their Quest.

- Implement it within the structure of the Quest as in the Actual Structuring section. Give the Quest meat on its bones through smaller steps and subquests within the main Quest.

- Consult Chapter 4: Skills and Gambits for more information on gambits.
- Tailor to your player’s means and tastes.
- Figure out how much XP, roughly, you want each step and such should be.

- Once you’ve finished drafting everything, keep it that way. Don’t set things in stone, lest you need to change it when the players inevitably derail some of your plans.

- Avoid repetition in your quests; this is a tabletop game, not a videogame. Roleplay and freedom of action plays a greater role, and actually playing gets stale and repetitive more easily such that grinding like in the latter is something to be avoided if possible.
- Remember to cut out extraneous checks, DCs, and NPCs when possible. If you feel something’s too short, you can improvise and add them on after; when all else is already planned out, adding to it is easier than removing.

#### The XP Question

But What is XP?

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Experience Table, Combat|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Level|Tier|CR 1|CR 2|CR 3|CR 4|CR 5|
|1|0|5|15|30|50|75|
|2 - 4|1|10|30|60|100|150|
|5 - 9|2|30|90|180|300|450|
|10 - 13|3|145|435|870|1450|2175|
|14 - 17|4|270|810|1620|2700|4050|
|18 - 20|5|700|2100|4200|7000|10500|
|Notes: If using a single monster, their EXP (and any drops) are already listed on their block. Use this if you're designing encounters with multiple monsters.<br><br>Consult CR table for thresholds, the XP award is per player, SM no longer needs to multiply and divvy up XP totals. Also, give half XP on a failure, i.e. the player chooses to flee.|   |   |   |   |   |   |

A player in any given tier will want to start off with CR 1, moving onto CR 2 as they get the hang of things. As they alchemize gear of their current tier, they'll be ready for CR 3, though they'll want all of it ready before tackling CR 4.

When designing an encounter, just add the CR of all its participants:

- Encounter has two CR 1 Imps? It's a CR 2 encounter.
- Throwing a CR 2 Ogre and a CR 1 Imp? It's a CR 3 encounter.
- Three CR 2 Ogres? It's a CR 6 encounter and you should probably ask yourself if there's a more stylish way your player might be destroyed.

A monster from one tier higher counts as twice its CR, while a monster one tier lower counts as half its CR.

- Do you hate your player? They're Tier 1? Throw eight Tier 0 CR 1 imps at them, this would be a CR 4 encounter.
- Do you also hate your player? They're Tier 2? A single Tier 3 CR 2 Acheron would also be a CR 4 encounter for them.

The thresholds for what constitutes a fight of some CR depends on the number of players and NPCs on the player’s side. If there are multiple players, or if the player has any NPCs with them, the CR thresholds must be multiplied by the number of actors to get an accurate reading.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Experience Table, Gambits|   |   |   |
|Player Level|Tier|EXP|EXP Multiplier|
|1|0|20|If DC 10, halve the EXP.|
|2 - 4|1|40|
|5 - 9|2|120|If DC 20, twice the EXP.|
|10 - 13|3|580|
|14 - 17|4|1080|If DC 25, thrice the EXP.|
|18 - 20|5|2800|
|Notes: The default gambit is DC 15.<br><br>Give half XP on a failure. But a player voluntarily ending a gambit isn't always a failure.|   |   |   |

This is a baseline, in the fashion that you can throw gambits at a player regardless of their skill set. You can and should tailor more difficult gambits to their intended player’s strengths, but you no longer need to be as constantly mindful of each player’s specific build for the easier DCs.

For reference, here are the DCs.

- DC 10 (Easy)
- DC 15 (Medium)
- DC 20 (Hard)
- DC 25 (Extreme)

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Experience Table, Story Beat|   |   |   |
|Tier|Minor|Decent|Notable|
|0|5|15|30|
|1|10|30|60|
|2|30|90|180|
|3|145|435|870|
|4|270|810|1620|
|5|700|2100|4200|
|Notes: These represent XP rewards for story beats, particularly enchanting RP moments, and other things you think deserves a reward.<br><br>Remember, XP is a potent carrot. Reward behavior you want to see in your players, and they'll continue it.|   |   |   |

What counts as minor, decent, or notable? Let’s segue into the next topic.

Rewards as Tools

A basic concept in psychology is positive reinforcement, where a desirable reaction to a behavior increases the frequency of that behavior. How does this relate to RPGStuck, and to tabletop gaming as a whole?

Reward players when they complete plans of action, or milestones, or exceptional bouts of roleplay. More specifically, reward the ones of which you want to see more. Players will then seek to do more of this to get more XP, and the feedback loop grows. In this way, you can cultivate the sort of playstyles you want to see in your sessions.

Milestone Leveling

Milestone leveling is a concept by which the players don’t level up based on XP gained, but by reaching certain accomplishments or completing certain works. This has the advantage of acting as a framework by which a session’s quests and arcs can be planned out, but the disadvantage that you will have to either be able to make judgment calls on what counts as a milestone, have planned out your session to a great detail such that you can assign milestones, or realistically a mix of both.

#### The Boondollar Question

That’s a Question?

Through normal play, a player can expect to pick up a few followers, a fraymotif or two, and some spending money for shenanigans, solely with the boondollars they gain from leveling up. A great deal of what a player would spend boondollars on is elucidated on in Housebuilding, where followers and other services are located.

Everything a player needs to progress in power with grist, namely alchemy, can be substituted with boondollars. In this way, the enterprising, determined player could pull off a pacifist run, no longer shackled to needing to slay underlings for grist. In practice, however, they will be strapped for resources compared to their less scrupulous coplayers.

Boondollars act as a supplement; you will no longer feel as though you MUST provide fights for grist even if the situation does not call for it. Any “paper loss of grist” players supposedly might incur that would preclude their acquisition of alchemy upgrades can be made up by buying equivalent items with boondollars. In this way, you are free to run a session how you wish, without being bound by a combat/grist quota.

If you wish to reward players more boondollars, you are recommended to tie it to events such that the process of getting these boondollars would give them XP. You can then multiply the XP reward by 10 in order to get the boondollar reward. SMs who have read Housebuilding may note that the same 10:1 conversion exists for boondollars and build grist. This is deliberate.

#### Exploration

The Open World

Exploration, more than any other, needs a wide, detailed world to explore because this is the main draw. Getting to a place isn’t a means to an end, the place is the end, and the journey there is the means.

When running an exploratory section, break it down by the following.

- Where are they going, and how important is it that they do?
- How long will it take to get there?

- Are there consequences for not making it in time? Or benefits if they get there early?
- Any methods of transportation or other speedier methods than walking available?

- Are there multiple ways to get there?

- Is there any way by which a way can be blocked off?
- Or the way is blocked off to start with, but that can change?

- Is there a way to fail to get there?

- And what happens if they do?
- Can they still progress at all if they do?

- And if not, what then?

Characters with high Intelligence or Wisdom and their associated skills may have an easier time solving challenges or navigating the wilderness, though many skills have a use somewhere. The only odd duck out here is Charisma.

You may want to check Chapter 4: Skills and Gambits, as exploration of an area is prime for a gambit.

Where’s the Meat?

Ask yourself what the point of an exploratory section is. Is it downtime between scenes of high action? Just another part of the adventure? What do you have in mind? As an aside, if you don’t really have anything in mind, treat it as a transitory scene and skip it.

- Roleplay. The plot arc can occasionally meander and take its time. Stop to smell the flowers, attract a songbird, check to count the number of branches on a tree.
- Gambits. Gambits let the player take exploration into their own hands, by setting the exploration of the region as a goal.
- The [Walk and Talk](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://walkandtalk&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040361020&usg=AOvVaw2oyWIPM5tECiSxHP-Jj0QH) trope. This one combines filling out transitory exposition and giving the player exposition. Alternatively, instead of exposition, it can be a simple conversation to deepen a player’s relationship with another player or an NPC.

- It helps serve a downtime function while still advancing the plot in some way.

- Random events. There are hundreds of lists of random events out there, on the Internet. Pick the ones that make sense for your session.

#### Stealth

Cardboard Boxes

Stealth is a fairly easy concept to grasp, from a very young age; don’t get caught. Adding onto that, misdirection, lies, and escaping accountability are parts of the roguish archetype with which the sneaky types are associated.

When running stealthy sections, ask yourself the following.

- Why does the player need to sneak about instead of moving in the open?

- Does it benefit the player or their goals if they keep their hand hidden?

- What are the consequences of getting caught?

- And who is doing the catching?
- Can the player talk, fight, or run out of the consequences?
- And can they try again if they do?

Characters with high Dexterity will, for obvious reasons, have a much better time sneaking around. However, unlike Exploration, Diplomacy, or Combat, stealth has a bit less room in which degrees of success/failure and improvisation can be done. It’s still certainly possible, but needs a bit more creativity than say, combat.

You may want to check Chapter 4: Skills and Gambits, as a gambit can abstract infiltrating or obfuscating on a large scale, beyond a solitary check to fool a single guard.

Even if Nailed Down…

Stealthy players also have a tendency to be kleptomaniacal, and not without reason; if they’re not going to be caught, or if the opposing side deserves it in some way, why not take as they please? Certainly an inventory load won’t stop them when they can throw everything in their sylladex.

If an item exists and is within reach, the player will probably try to take it. Don’t put anything near them that you don’t want them to have; experience has shown not only will players go to extreme lengths to take something they shouldn’t have, they tend to get disproportionately upset if denied said item.

#### Diplomacy

Casting Call

Diplomacy needs a fleshed out cast of characters with which the player can conduct conversation. Whether to lie to them, scare them, or sway them, the player needs someone on which their actions can be done. Role-playing and choosing one’s words carefully

In addition to everything asked when the NPC was first created, consider the following when running a diplomatic section.

- What does the player want from it?
- Is there a reason for the other side to be opposed?
- Do their words and actions reveal more about the character?

- If so, or if not, is it deliberate?

Charisma is the stat of choice for diplomacy, for obvious reasons. Experience shows that this is the one where dice and numbers tend to be waved over the most in favor of satisfying roleplay.

You may want to check Chapter 4: Skills and Gambits, as social encounters were one of the primary drivers behind the formation of the gambit system.

#### Combat

Resiste et Mords

Combat comes to RPGStuck easily, given its wargaming roots. And as such, it is easily prone to [defaulting to combat for everything](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040371530&usg=AOvVaw2LRHpw4Xmi-o50eKpCImLa).

Therefore, consider the following when planning or running combat sections.

- When should you do it?

- Is it a means to an end or the end itself?
- Have all other means been exhausted, or is this the option that’s best for the player?

- A strife can be an alternative to other means. One doesn’t need to be sneaky with no witnesses, if there is no one left to witness. Or perhaps the player wishes to intimidate an opposing party through a duel or some display of strength.

- Have any other actions taken by the player before this strife coming back to affect it in some way?

- When should you not do it?

- Filler. Filling in empty space with a fight purely to take up space is unimaginative, and makes it that much easier for the player to be sick of combat.

- If a strife is fun, then run it by all means. Just keep in mind that consistent fun is one of the hardest things for an SM to do, in any game.
- As the only consequence for every failed action. Not every failed check should spring a fight. Some, like failed Stealth checks, might not make sense with anything but a fight.
- In moderation, strifes are fine. If every dungeon and every gauntlet ends with a strife, it gets predictable.

- As the first response to an obstacle. Strife is a means to an end, in the majority of cases. Consider if there are alternate methods for the player to get what they want.

As for how to go about it, follow the guidelines below.

- Consider what the point of the strife is, then weigh the player’s options to achieving that goal.

- If the player has an objective to complete, the strife can be secondary to completing said objective.

- If the player simply needs to go through an area, Dashing through the gauntlet is often a viable option, even on the combat map.

- Fleeing and being captured are two popular alternatives, though experience shows players rarely flee.
- Certain types of monsters like Glaciers and Casters buck the trend of normal strifes, the former encouraging the player to circumvent the strife and the latter able to deny the player a strife entirely.

- Figure out encounter ranges. Typically, the strife will start when one side both perceives them and is able to attack them. For players and monsters both, this is when their farthest range action is available to use, or when they can open fire.
- Use the environment. Ranged monsters will want cover, burrowers want solid ground, flyers air, and aquatic water. Monsters with good stealth will hide from the player, those with area of effect abilities will want to use it to full effect.

- A given object might serve as cover for a monster. Or for the player. Overturned tables, doors, etc.
- Ledges, spiked walls, and the like are perfect for movement shenanigans.
- Think vertically. This one becomes incredibly important if/when the player god tiers and has permanent flight.

- Theater of the mind, or describing a strife purely through text and the like, is simple enough to use for small strifes. Anything involving several monsters, or those with complex abilities, or multiple players will want a strife map to track everything.

Murderhoboism

Murderhobos are a type of character with little backstory or personality, that exist mainly to fight and kill to level up to facilitate further fighting and killing without much other purpose or nuance. Understandably, this should be avoided at all costs.

If you end up with such a player, throw them challenges where combat is not an option. Make them think outside the box.

- An exception is if you, the SM, enjoy holding strifes, in which case the player’s constant seeking of strifes probably isn’t a problem to you.

Also, be wary of turning players into murderhobos over time. If they are given no outlets by which progress is made except combat, they will logically turn to it as the best and/or only way to continue.

Challenges

This one is straightforward; if the player has to start a strife, it’s under this. Note that not every strife needs to end in death for one side.

Consider the area in which the strife takes place. The player will almost never be in an isolated, flat vacuum. Consider the following common elements of a map.

- Difficult terrain.

- Solid impediments. Caltrops, viper pit, snow, ice.
- Liquid. Water is the obvious one.
- Gas. Poison gas, obscuring fog, a really bad stench.

- Light levels.

- Dim light and darkness.
- Ridiculously bright, blinding light.

- Cover.

- Half and three-quarters cover for AC and Reflex.
- Destructible cover to be torn down if needed.

- Interactable objects.

- Consult the Obstacle/Puzzle Design section further down this document.

### ==> Chapter 4: Skills and Gambits

"Is mayonnaise an instrument?"

#### The Role of Skills

Two Guidances

As you read through this guide, you may find specific examples of what a given DC represents, or what counts as a gambit or a stakes/flaws die. We would give you two pieces of advice:

- Internal consistency is more important than orthodoxy; your gambits may be different in difficulty, or in usage, or players can use their skills in novel ways, or your idea of the difficulty classes deviates from here. Whatever you do, just be consistent about it.
- Stakes dice only come into play in checks and gambits, and those only come into play where uncertainty is involved. If something that counts for stakes or flaws would also remove the uncertainty to begin with, reconsider needing any rolling to begin with.

How do I Shot Web

Not everything needs a skill check. Be sparse with them when possible. If you’re unsure when you should prompt a check, ask yourself the following.

- Is there a challenge to be overcome? And is the outcome reasonably uncertain?
- Is there a cost for failing?

If the answer to both questions is no, it does not need a skill check or a gambit.

How do I Not Shot Web

Sometimes, a check isn’t required. For example, a DC 5 skill check to someone with a +12 modifier would be pointless, as would asking a DC 40 check to someone with +3 to the modifier. If a player uses overwhelming, irrefutable evidence and logical reasoning to convince someone of their position, consider bypassing the check; if there is no meaningful chance of failure, then in most cases a check should not be called for. If a failed check would cause the other party to act in illogical ways or contrary to their character, similarly consider bypassing the check.

Additionally, there are some barriers that cannot be crossed by social expertise alone. For example, a stranger cannot be convinced to go on a murderous rampage just by words. Or a player with a fear of needles to step into an iron maiden. If a task is physically impossible, a natural 20 won’t work either.

There is also another case when you wouldn’t want to prompt a skill check, or are recommended not to do so; if it’s something you need the player to pass in order to proceed with their adventure, either do not prompt a check, allow other methods by which it can be done if they fail, or change the failure condition to include a complication, a partial success, or something that lets them get on with it while still having failed and dealing with the consequences.

Skills, In-Depth

The skills are fairly straightforward, but let’s look a bit deeper into what fields of activity could be encompassed by them. Not all skills will be discussed here: some are just that intuitively straightforward.

- Athletics: The difference between a simple Strength check and an Athletics check relies on whether any form of finesse is required. A simple push, or pull, or some other simple motion might be done with a Strength check, but as any bodybuilder will tell you, even simple motions have technique behind them. Regardless, let’s look at some examples that might not be immediately apparent.

- The player is climbing a rocky wall, when they lose their grip and they begin falling. The player checks to see if they can catch themselves while falling. Or perhaps someone else falls, and they check to see if they can catch the falling ally. Or they think of this, decide not to risk it, and accept a higher DC in exchange for climbing faster.

- The player decides to reenact a movie they once saw and swing from vine to vine in a jungle. Or rope to rope in a dungeon. Or they just jump the distances required instead. In the case of the last one, they refrain from making a check for every jump, as that would be tedious.

- Acrobatics: Acrobatics covers attempts to stay on one’s feet, as well as maneuvers that require agility more than strength. Let’s look at some examples.

- The player must jump from a great height, and they see if they can dive into the water below safely, or roll upon landing to avoid taking damage.
- The player must move through a small vent in order to infiltrate a building. Or perhaps they tried, got caught, and now must slip their bonds to escape.

- Sleight of Hand: other actions that require fine finger control, such as playing a stringed instrument, disabling traps, crafting a minute object, performing a medical operation, or the obvious, picking a lock, use Sleight of Hand as well.

- Note that most of these cAn be justified with other skills, and often are. Instruments may, and often do, require a Performance check instead. Disabling traps and crafting objects can call for Engineering instead. And medical operations almost always calls for Medicine instead, the manual control required often being assumed.
- As a rule of thumb, if the check requires knowledge, it often won’t use Sleight of Hand.

- Gambits, however, not being limited to a single check, can make good use of this.

- Engineering: Note that engineering in real life encompasses a wide variety of fields, and thus so can this. Let’s look at a few examples.

- Chemical engineering is a popular field. The key to differentiating between this and Medicine is the nature of the chemicals; organic ones are more for Medicine, while non-organic is firmly Engineering.
- The player needs to design and create a cybernetic arm. This one is straightforward, but one with basis in canon.
- The player lost the plans for the not totally a death star, and must recreate the plans from memory and physics knowledge. Or perhaps it’s too late, the star is already here, and the player must discern a weakness within the vessel.

- Investigation: While piecing together clues and deducing from them is obvious, sometimes the circumstances for which Investigation can be used aren’t so clear. Let’s look at a few.

- The player is currently playing shopkeeper, and is offered an item of unknown value. Clearly, there is appraising to be done. And if it is magical, to identify it. Or perhaps the scrutiny reveals that it’s a forgery.
- The player has spent the last several hours learning about the life of a consort they really, really don’t care about, but they hid a treasure and the player intends to find it. They check to deduce if they can discern where they would’ve hid this treasure from their knowledge of the consort’s habits and thinking.

- Occult: Occult is a catch-all skill for all sorts of phenomena, whether it be psionic, actually magical, grimdark, or what have you. Let’s see an example or two.

- The player baits and triggers a trap, and a spell is performed, incinerating the hallway where they might’ve been, were they less wary. They check to see if they can identify the nature of the spell and its original caster.
- There is a magical artifact, or a magical individual, and the player checks to determine exactly how powerful they are.

- Animal Handling: This is relatively straightforward, but the applications are numerous.

- The player trains several guard dogs to accompany them as hunting dogs, using their superior sense of smell to seek out targets. They are taught to fetch, to bury objects, to back off from a fight, sneak, track and flank quarry, obey only the player, and a dozen other things.
- The player, across multiple encounters with a non-sentient antagonist, realizes their psychology is more like a beast’s than a human’s or troll’s. They then use this knowledge against them, playing to their instincts to get the upper hand.

- Insight: Let’s take the trope of [the social expert](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040402008&usg=AOvVaw2BZBNr4kaPPgxIt-xZlm8W) and expound on that. Insight, more than just being an anti-Deception check akin to Perception for Stealth, is the ability to read people, social situations, power dynamics, and anything to do with emotions or psychology. All of the following examples use Insight.

- After studying an enemy’s childhood and what makes them tick, the player feels they understand the enemy intimately, and can play off their personality. Break them by reminding them of past failures, dredge up childhood phobias, appeal to long-lost ideals and memories, among others.
- The player walks into a room with several staff members. The player reads each staff member to learn the social and power dynamics in the room. Who is in charge, who is subordinate, who gossips, who is popular in the group, who is disliked in the group, how they feel about the nature of their work.
- The player follows someone around. They observe how they act, and through it, how they think. What they value, how they approach a problem, what they don’t think, what they like and don’t like, their strong points and weak points, who they like and dislike.
- There is a spy in the agency, and the player has their hunches. They follow on their hunches, make a check, and realize that the spy is not voluntarily doing so, but has been mind controlled in some way.

- Medicine: Some examples of Medicine beyond triage.

- The player is investigating a possible poisoning, and their leads have led them to the kitchens as one possible source. The player inspects the utensils, the kitchen’s habits, grills the staff, checks the cleaners used, and searches for any source of contamination.
- There is a giant, rampaging monster tearing up the land, and the player realizes it could be weakened enough to fight by feeding infected livestock to it. The monster, likely an underling, is not wholly human, but poison is poison, and the player aims to create a concentrated, targeted dose tailored against this particular threat.
- Hysteria from a rumor that a dead man walking haunts the town is dispelled by the player, who understands how a body can act while decomposing, and seeks to replicate it to disprove the rumor to the consorts of the town and end the mass hysteria. Or perhaps they find the bodies of one of the supposed victims, and perform an autopsy.

- Perception: Perception is a well-known skill, and its applications are numerous and well-known. However, it can be stretched just a bit further.

- The player is spying on a meeting of diplomats with the intention to eavesdrop. However, their bug malfunctioned, and they have no audio. So the player pulls out binoculars and proceeds to lipread both parties.
- Acoustic cryptanalysis is a side channel attack on encrypted systems that relies on hearing what sort of noise a computer makes. The player decides to listen to someone entering their information into an ATM, to remember it and repeat it to hack into their accounts.

- Sanity: While the uses for Sanity seem obvious, let’s see a few examples.

- The Noble Circle of Horrorterrors has taken an interest in the player, and is gaslighting them with double images and auditory hallucinations, slowly and subtly. They must make one daily or the gaslighting worsens until reality and illusion are indistinguishable.
- The player is stuck in line at the bank, and the customer in front of them is an old lady making a deposit. She takes out a jar of pennies and begins counting, one at a time.

- Survival: as seen in its description, encompasses a wide variety of talents that don’t necessarily all fall under the umbrella of being nature and rural based only.

- The player is leading an expedition into an unknown land. They use a gambit to represent overall navigation, supplies, and other factors of a journey with large groups over the long term.
- Let’s say there is a cave. Or there is a mineshaft. Or a quarry in the distance. Or the player is currently under the earth. The player checks to see how deep it might go, or how far away a target is, how deep they are, or figure out direction and where they are in the world.

- Deception: If an approach does not rely on the truth, it usually uses Deception. This does not always rely on the verbal truth; body language has always been a thing. Let’s look at some examples of Deception, with that in mind.

- At a diplomatic meeting, the player must signal to a visiting diplomat without alerting anyone else that a message is being sent. Perhaps they use language in a particular way that only the intended person understands.
- There is a party, but the player is not invited. Not being one to shy from crashing parties, the player disguises themselves. Then the party also has a no weapons policy, so the player disguises theirs as an ornament or a toy.
- There is a death sentence on the player’s head, and the police have sent bounty hunters after them. The player feigns a weakness to draw them in for the kill. Or perhaps they go more extreme and just feign death.
- There is an NPC the player must court in some way, but they have a terrible Persuasion skill. So they use Deception to seduce the target.
- There is a dignitary visiting the town soon and the player intends to ensure the town gives them a cold reception. So they go into local watering holes to spread rumors. Or perhaps they meet with the mayor, present the idea of snubbing the dignitary in a subtle manner, and put the idea into their head without realizing that they were the one to suggest it.

- Intimidation: Threatening someone is not always verbal, nor does it need to be overt to the onlooker. Let’s look at some examples.

- Stuck in a butcher’s shop for some reason, the player dons a bloody apron, smears their face, and grabs a knife. The police walk in, and the player puts on the appearance and mannerisms of a bloodthirsty slaughterer, down to the twitches of eyes and fingers and the too-wide smile. All without saying a word.
- In real life, torture doesn’t actually work. However, this is a game, and the player amps up the psychological factor of their interrogation without actually increasing the harm inflicted.

- Performance: Performance aims to elicit some sort of emotion from the other party. Let’s look at a few examples.

- Not so much an example as a list. Acting, comedy, dance, keyboard, oratory, percussion, string, wind, singing. Perhaps these can gain the player boondollars or spare grist, somehow. Or more likely, gain the attention of a more plot-relevant patron.
- The player decides to run a misinformation campaign against the rulers of the land in order to begin a rebellion. So to that end, they host a performance with tunes and lyrics shaped to influence its listeners.

- Persuasion: Let’s look at some examples of Persuasion.

- The player correctly appraised and bought the item used in the Investigation example, and is now bartering a price on the resale.
- Following the Investigation example, the player elicits to gather information directly from the people, using their words instead of their detective acuity. Perhaps even a bribe here and there when the normal words fail.
- At yet another diplomatic summit, the player must delay as long as possible, yet do so without being caught. Unable or unwilling to lie, the player instead uses existing information to bring the sides to argue, bicker, waste time, or otherwise complicate the summit.

#### Gambit, In-Depth

Of all the events and actions for which gambits might be used, there are a few recurring types that deserve special mention. Stealth, Exploration, and Social, as described in the previous chapter, encompass a wide variety of gambits. Additionally, Chases and Research will be discussed in some small part.

Keep in mind that these types are not exclusive. Let’s go over a few examples.

- Stealth, Deception. The player wants to walk into Derse’s parliamentary building and filch some papers. They’d prefer not to be detected at all, but if they are, they intend to talk their way through.
- Engineering, Perception, Survival. The player believes a quest macguffin is located inside the hold of a fallen carapacian ship, since overgrown with flora. They will navigate via their knowledge of botany where the ship is overgrown, and their knowledge of ship designs where not.
- Persuasion, Athletics, Acrobatics. The player is chasing down a reticent NPC through a busy city market. They want to convince them to stop the chase, but they’ll catch the slippery little twerp by force if they have to.

Stealth Gambits

Stealth gambits are straightforward; the player wants to sneak across some sort of obstacle between them and their goal, except said obstacle might be eleven dead man’s switch-wired guards, eight cameras, and a small robot dog. Alternatively, a gauntlet where there is significantly higher tolerance for detection, which is implied in the gambit framework to begin with; the hidden/detected binary is not enough when neutral and pass/fail with complication/saving grace outcomes are possible.

Stealth and Perception are the primary drivers here, but other skills can be of tangential use:

- Investigation in place of Perception, if the avenues of movement are limited and the emphasis is on following, not searching. One could argue for Insight, if the one using it knows the Stealth side very well, though this is a long shot.
- Survival in place of Stealth, concerning the wilderness, though this would be more concerned with blending into the environment and concealing one’s tracks than actually stealthily moving.

Exploration Gambits

Exploration gambits can help fill in the downtime that transitory episodes tend to be, compared to social or combative matters. It also helps worldbuild-heavy SMs make full use of their maps and figures.

There are multiple ways an exploration gambit can go, usually dependent on the type of environment being explored.

- Survival is the go-to for anything out in the wilderness.
- Engineering is the reverse, often good for anything made by hands or machines, carapacian, consort, or otherwise.
- Occult and Investigation are more specific, when their skills might apply. If the locale is particularly mystical, or cleaves strongly to some sort of paradigm, then those skills might take prominence.
- Perception can substitute for any of these, but might not be as suited as those skills, depending on the circumstances.

Social Gambits

Social gambits are one of the most common types of challenges and goals around, if the countless pesterlogs in Homestuck are any indication. This is one of the more intuitive gambits, able to rely only on the player and the NPC(s).

All the Charisma skills are equally suitable for this, but Insight is also a defense.

- Deception comes in when any sort of lies or deceit is involved. A rule of thumb is that if Insight or Perception seeing through it would hinder it, Deception is used.
- Intimidation does not need to be overt; it represents some show of force to coerce or command another into acting differently, whether said show be overt or subtle.
- Persuasion is used when attempting to sway another’s thoughts, motives, or actions. It can be said to cover whatever the two above skills would not.
- Performance is fairly straightforward, and can do any of the other skills, though its application has more requirements.
- Insight is for a player on the other end, if they wish to determine the truth of what someone is telling them. Pure Insight gambits can be a bit unwieldy, however.

There is an important distinction to be made concerning social gambits, whether it should be against a DC or an opposed roll. If a player wanted to convince an NPC, that would be a DC check, except Insight to oppose a Deception gambit. An opposed gambit with Charisma on both sides would not be to convince each other, but to convince a third party. The go-to example would be a debate.

Other Gambits and Dice

Chases are also easily modeled with gambits: at its simplest, opposed Athletics checks to simulate a chase scene works well enough. Add in more skills to suit it to the environment, such as Acrobatics where parkour and obstacles are involved, and just about any chase can be simulated.

Research, or investigative, is also straightforward, and simple enough that it did not merit a section of its own. Research also does not tend to be opposed, for the simple fact that it begs a lot of unnecessary questions, if the goal is simply to find some fact(s). There is one nuance, however, in that research/investigative partial successes will often yield some of the facts, but not all; lay out their partial facts such that a savvy player might be able to piece together the clues despite the missing info. This engages the player and rewards them for deductive thinking. Feeling good about crits comes every time a crit is rolled, but feeling vindicated by being smart is far rarer and accordingly valuable.

To round out this section, here are some more examples of gambit dice. Remember that conditions that would ask for three dice of either kind, if it would be the only condition given, should almost seem guaranteed and not worth using a gambit for. Do remember that in cases like these, story beat XP exists to still reward players if gambits wouldn’t make sense.

- One die.

- Stakes: Muffled shoes, a compass and binoculars, or some simple, mundane equipment.
- Flaws: The lack of equipment thereof. Trying to sway someone who you cut off in traffic earlier that day.

- Two dice.

- Stakes: Well-made, high quality equipment. Sneaking in the dead of night. Chasing someone while intangible.
- Flaws: The opposite, comically poor gear or trying to sneak about in the noonday sun. Using an incomplete codec for translation. Running in stiletto heels.

- Three dice.

- Stakes: Using robotic surgery tools, chasing down someone on foot with a hoverboard, cowing half an army into fleeing right after slaying their leader and the other half first.
- Flaws: Sneaking into a military base with clown shoes and glowing clothes. Swaying an audience to vote for you right after eating a baby in front of them.

##### Additional Gambit Types

Overclock Gambits

In an overclock gambit, the number of skill checks made is fixed, with checks still made if the player accrues the five successes necessary. If they achieve ten successes, they gain an additional benefit as designated by the SM.

Consequences can be inverted for some examples.

- Inverted harm. Everyone loves healing. Consider it an adrenaline rush or the thrill of victory.

- Inverted resource and price. The player gains something they didn't expect. Their spent resources are refilled. A spare jeweled ring was found during the work. A lesser slot is refilled by the spirits.

- Inverted surprise. It's still not anticipated, but is positive. The target of your private party infiltration is conveniently heading to the basement alone.

- You gain control, and proceeding with your next steps becomes easier. The combination for the lock turns out to be the combination for every lock in the facility.

- An anticipated future obstacle resolves itself. You snuck out of the house, your cool neighbor offers to drive you to the party.

- You gain a new opportunity that unlocks a new avenue of approach. You got into the jewelry shop with the quest macguffin you need, but the villain of the week who wears armor necessitating said macguffin is vulnerably shopping inside.

Then of course, there are other benefits that can be granted.

- Reduce the gambit bar/clock of a catastrophe gambit.

- Reduce the difficulty of an upcoming strife in some way.

- Simply grant extra experience, grist, boondollars, or something else.

Catastrophe Gambits

A catastrophe gambit is the least like a gambit, able to be unbound to a singular narrative event that would require a gambit. Consider it a ticking doom counter that promises dire consequences, called the catastrophe, if the counter ever fills.

Consequences can be made as normal, but should be particularly heinous. If the gambit bar fills for a catastrophe gambit, it can be emptied and reused if the nature of the catastrophe makes it repeatable or can be escalated.

Catastrophe gambits can be used to count up failed gambits in lieu of other consequences. In particular, the Fivefold Framework scenariostuck ticks up the bar whenever the player falls to 0 HP and would otherwise be defeated.

##### Modifying Gambits

A gambit typically requires 5 successes in 3 checks and a 4th at disadvantage. There are several ways to modify it.

- Increase or decrease the number of successes required.

- Increase or decrease the number of checks that can be made.

- Impose a default number of stakes or flaws dice on the gambit.

- Introduce a complication, which is an unanticipated event that occurs some time during the gambit, typically after a check is made and its associated narrative event resolved.

- The complication itself can be as simple as requiring an additional check or suffering its consequences (like damage), something more sinister like reducing the successes earned from the preceding check, or esoteric like precluding the ability to rest until after the next check of the gambit.
- On the flip side, you can grant a reward for successfully resolving the event, like a stakes die on the rest of the gambit.

- Introduce demeanor for an opponent in an opposed gambit. Use this sparingly.

Scenariostuck Sample

This is an example of a gambit template used in scenariostuck.

Self-Aware Colony

Overclock Gambit

Gambit Clock: 4 (starts at 0)

Stakes/Flaws: 2 flaws

Complication: 1

DC: 20

Description:

The denizens of the Third City of the New Commandment, and most cities of the Bloodbrine, are home to the vast majority of remaining grimdark, those who survived the Century's End. They concern themselves with their own affairs, with outward-facing forces limited to the Hosts and minorities within the Drowned Assembly. This is not to say its inhabitants are unable to fight. Just happens this lot will only be able to fight one, not both.

- [[Optional theme for the Scene](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DuzG5JFreTWQ&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040451345&usg=AOvVaw3uApvEZ81AQByLowg65abT)]

(Opportunities) Actions: The overclock gambit concludes after each of the four have been done. They can be done in any order.

- Rockwell's Watching Me: The overgrown beetle, he claims to be immortal; whenever he desires, he can self-terminate and begin regeneration within the pits of any of the Cities of the New Commandment. Unfortunately, a previous encounter left him with a faerie mark that tracks his exact location. Psi skill, Occult, or Survival to undo the mark, or any Charisma skill to convince him it's not as big a deal as he thinks.
- Shelved Implication: The edgy knife robot, it carries a watermelon-sized capsule of heinous implication with the breadth of its replication. It allows the robot to wield the aspect of Space as a Child of Skaia. It is of Alternian make. It requires priming to properly recalibrate it to Paradox Space, necessary in the heart of the Furthest Ring. Spend 1 AP, or utilize any skill of player's choice as they manipulate their aspect at a deeply abstract and unfamiliar level.
- My Life as a Teenage Horrorterror: The entitled child, they have a problem; their homework has been left undone and it must be done lest their father make life difficult. Any Intelligence or Wisdom skill to get the child started on any of its sections, or any Charisma skill to convince them to stop procrastinating.
- Lesson of the Held Image: The robot shell of herself, she needs preparation to use her powers properly. A held image that the shell will take into her mind for seven seconds in which she will destroy it seven times seven times seven ways. Then she will open her eyes and understand the manner in which her target will die. Endurance or Sanity to be the draft from which she creates the held image, or psi skill or Occult to aid in its creation.

Complication: When the player makes a skill check for any of the given actions above, they can run into a complication that makes the affair harder than it should've been.

- Red Interruption (between checks): There are robot clowns running through the streets in the shape and seeming of… imps. Imps? This late into the session, at this point in the Act, in this fucking Furthest Ring, localized entirely during the player's gambit? Yes. May they see it? Yes. Attack roll or psi check, Animal Handling, Insight, or any Charisma skill to get them to shoo, or any Intelligence skill to disable them. If failed, they still flee, but not before slapping the player with a serrated ruby claw for 10d10+45 damage.

Victory:

If the player has succeeded on the gambit when all four opportunities are completed (or ends them early after passing it), the preparation is made and the group says their farewells as they go off to deal with whichever co-player was not chosen. The player, with little else to do, goes off to deal with the chosen co-player.

Defeat:

If the player completes all four opportunities and has not passed the gambit, they still say their farewells and go off to slay the unchosen co-player. However, their imagined victory fails to materialize and they are slaughtered. In Scene 20, in The Araxes Arrangement, replace one of the encounters with the Empty Vengeance.

Overclock:

If the player passes the gambit twice or more, their Fated End gambit clock ticks down by 1 as described in that gambit.

#### Encounter and Journey Design

Encounter Design

Let's define an encounter as a meeting between the player and one or more NPCs. These NPCs might be consorts, underlings, carapacians, grimdark, etc. There are a variety of means by which they can be dealt with, described in detail in the listings for that encounter.

As a general rule, the player can typically Scrutinize a situation before jumping into it, or Discerning it if they don't have that kind of time. If specific skills are needed, using Investigation, Occult, Perception, or Insight is a good idea. The SM can respond to these inquiries with the varied ways listed for an encounter on how to proceed.

There are several ways for an encounter to resolve. Let's list some of the most common.

- Roll for initiative and start a strife.

- Sneak past them, or if mobile, hide and wait till it passes.

- If the encounter is sapient, converse with it.

- If conversing isn't an option, exploit its nature. Beasts can be handled, psionic creatures can be dealt with through such, machines and undead can have exploits found in their patterns.

- Other means like fleeing from them, or something roleplay-based than check-based.

Ordeals and Gates

There are two notable subtypes of encounters.

Ordeals tend to be environmental hazards, arcane phenomena, or otherwise threats that can't be fought but must be solved, mitigated, or otherwise handled to proceed. Since fighting them isn't an option, it narrows their resolution methods accordingly. Simply suffering the consequences of the ordeal is an option as well. There are several types of ordeals.

- An ordeal of Enigma, a puzzle which must be discerned.

- An ordeal of Desolation, mental anguish which must be resisted.

- An ordeal of Agony, physical trauma which must be endured.

- An ordeal of Rhetoric, an obstacle which must be communicated with.

- An ordeal of Flight, a pursuing threat which must be escaped.

- An ordeal of Pursuit, an escaping obstacle which must be pursued.

Gates are more stationary versions of ordeals, where they can be retried with a different approach at no additional consequence should the first attempt fail. However, they have a higher DC to compensate. These gates typically fall into one of three (not mutually exclusive) categories.

- A hidden gate, which must be found.

- A locked gate, which must be unlocked.

- A puzzle gate, which must be solved.

Journeys

Journeys refer to abstracting a long period of travel down to a series of encounters where the player faces relevant difficulties that warrant notice in an otherwise unremarkable period of travel. As journeys are a series of encounters, all information relevant to standard encounters above also applies here.

Journeys also feature attrition, which is a uniform consequence that applies to failing encounters if none are given, typically damage (use the base damage of a CR1 to CR3 creature of the relevant tier as a baseline), taken in Ordeals and Gates as creature encounters typically have consequences of starting a strife if checks fail.

Scenariostuck Samples

These are examples of encounters, ordeals, gates, and journeys used in scenariostuck.

Ordeal - Subway Map:

- Inexplicable Bullshit: The subway line map is is a mess of tangled lines except only one of the lines goes anywhere, the rest possessing miniature black voids where stops ought to be. It's as though this was put here deliberately to screw with the player, or indeed, anyone trying to gain access to the Bloodbrine. Discern skill, Investigation, or Perception to figure it out, or psi skill, Occult, or Sanity to bend the map to the player's will.

Ordeal - Applause for the Fool:

- Crucible: The ordeal is DC 25 and is made at disadvantage.
- Last Chance: The threshold to the Duat is a black, inky thing of stars uncounted. Approaching it also wracks the player with incredible pain, as if to kill them now to spare them from worse fates than death, un and otherwise. The pain only abates with a display of prowess, asking the player to demonstrate their god tiered strength and prove their transfiguration into a configuration of Paradox Space has not stripped them of worth. Any skill check of choice will suffice.

Gate - Ticket Booth:

- Gate: The gate is DC 25, but can be retried with a different approach, or retry the same approach with disadvantage.
- Puzzle: The ticket machine is an arcane disaster that profanes the very concept of user experience, by design.

- Any Intelligence skill of choice or Perception to figure it out.
- Endurance or Sanity to power through the ruin of clunky purchasing options.
- Attack roll or psionic roll to smash the terminal until it spits out the tickets.
- Spend 1 AP to automatically succeed by paying the true price of the ticket.

- Consequences: If the player fails two tries at unlocking the runes, it activates child mode and patronizes the player in an appropriately condescending manner as it walks them through ticket purchasing.

Gate - Argos' Judgment:

- Gate: The gate is DC 20, but can be retried with a different approach, or retry the same approach with disadvantage.
- Puzzle: A very old, mangy, decrepit dog lies atop a pile of hay out of place in this region of Laurentia. It has been waiting for the player for a very long time.

- Pet the dog.
- Any other option is punished with psychic damage as they feel bad.
- Feeding the dog the fish from last Scene is acceptable.

Encounter - Skeletal Mob:

- Description: A mob of skeletons with crossbows and… bowler hats. Why? Just why.
- Default: If they see the player, they'll tell them to shove off, what're they doing here at this ungodly hour. Go home. Leave.
- Stealth: Sneaking by them with a Stealth or Survival check seems easy enough.
- Charm: They may be skeletons, but they ain't unreasonable. Any Charisma skill to talk past them oughta work.
- Consequence: If the player ops for a skill check to bypass the strife but fails, it's like they unblurred the photo and the boys will begin rattling. A strife begins.

Encounter - Aquaveil Highlich:

- Description: These bony creatures radiate power, moving in stilted motions across the city in their eternal vigil.
- Default: Should they see the player, there will only be strife.
- Chase: Outspeeding this dead wizard bitch is an option, fly into the city and lose it in the narrow alleyways and passages. Athletics to do so.
- Patrol Patterns: They seem to follow some manner of pattern, they do not fly aimlessly. This can be exploited. Investigation, Animal Handling, or Survival to figure out the patrol pattern and fly through a blind spot.
- Consequence: If they attempted a skill check and it fails, a strife ensues.

Encounter - Crateris Servitor:

- Description: An engram-guided psionic illusion given form, one of the Hydra's tools to conduct ritual work to make up for her seeming lack of grimdark followers. The illusion is a woman who instills inexplicable insights into the player; this is a facsimile of the Hydra's forms, or one of them. How vain.
- Default: It physically cannot attack or strife, but that may be worse. Its reaction is delayed long enough for the player to quickly choose and perform one course of action. Otherwise, it blows up and its contained engram releases a thoughtform that explodes for cognitive damage against the player.
- Stealth: Stealth to avoid disturbing it should give the player an opening to scatter its physical form.
- Arcana: Psi skill, Occult, Sanity, or Survival reveals the circle seems incredibly fragile and can be disrupted to collapse the illusion and its work.
- Charm: It purportedly has sophisticated response features, but not for players; the player might use any Charisma skill of choice to tell it they're on the same side.
- Consequence: If the player fails the check, it immediately explodes.

Encounter - The Burnished Kleptocrat, Station of the Canon:

- Description: Why is it the Black King turned on the player? Are they corrupted by the grimdark, or is it a natural inclination that causes the Reckoning to occur in any session, or have they just gone mad? A question for the ages, to be buried under a dozen more.

- [you might put an optional theme here to play when the time comes]

- Mandatory Strife: This strife is mandatory.

Kalahari Expedition

Journey

Trials: 3

Stakes/Flaws: 1 flaw

DC: 15

Description:

The Etsal River is a wide, angry thing that shows mercy only to the fish within it. Still, it serves as a loose landmark by which the player navigates their way across the land.

- Attrition: This journey requires Persistence. For every failed Ordeal or Gate, the player takes 2d10+9 damage.

Ordeal - NOT THE BEES:

- Wicker Man: No matter the scenario you cannot escape the bees. These nest in the soil, equipped with digging arms in addition to wings and stingers as though the Denizen couldn't make up their bloody mind when creating them. This also means they're underlings, technically. Animal Handling or Survival to placate the bees, or Athletics to try outrunning them.

Encounter - Kalahari Nomads:

- Description: They are hunting for deer, in the direction of deer.
- Default: They ask the player if they have seen a deer (they have not). The trick is that the deer in question is an amphibious creature that jumps out of the river, kicks one of the nomads in the groin, does not explain itself, and jumps back in.
- Swim: Jumping into the water after the deer may seem foolhardy, but it's not out of the question.
- Handling: The player can invite them to fish for smaller prey. This delays them for an hour as they fish, but well, it's fishing. Engineering, Animal Handling, or Survival to fish.
- Consequence: The Wild Card will notice if the check was failed and mock them accordingly.

Gate - Cataract Passage:

- Gate: The gate is DC 20, but can be retried with a different approach, or retry the same approach with disadvantage.
- Hidden Passageway: The cataract in question is seven different waterfalls where the river falls over a stairway-shaped series of cliffs. The river is especially strong here, with gravity's support.

- Athletics to endure the flow long enough to search all seven waterfalls.
- Investigation, Perception, or Survival to deduce which is the correct waterfall.
- Psi skill to detect the Mirrorshard and feel their way through.
- Spend 1 AP to automatically succeed in sensing the exact passage.

- Consequences: If the player fails two tries at passing this gate, a second deer emerges from the river and bowls them over as it runs toward some apple trees.

Victory:

- Conclusion: Past the waterfall lies the next Mirrorshard. The player finds its power boost immediate, granting them the Preserve power, though once the moment passes, the first surprise reveals themselves.

Upward Movement

Journey

Trials: 5

Stakes/Flaws: 2 flaws

DC: 20

Description:

The city teems with undeath, shambling carapacian corpses accompanied by their osseous constructs. The Duat itself seems extant, yet spectral and stark against the violet city stone. There is no trace of life even up here, no birds to be seen. On the horizon, great spikes of bone rise from the oceans, or are those the phalanges of some titanic defender laid low by the bloodbrine invaders?

- Attrition: This journey requires Persistence. For every failed Ordeal or Gate, the player takes 8d8+25 damage.

Ordeal - Anticlimactic Ascent:

- Iron Flight: The flight itself is harder than it ought to be, and not because it is unfamiliar to the player. No, there's some enchantment in the background that enervates the player, to say nothing of the errant lightning bolts. Athletics or Acrobatics to avoid the lightning, Endurance or Medicine to shrug off the enchantment, or psi skill, Occult, or Survival to ward it off.

- [[Optional theme for the Scene](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFhKJgqxNDD8&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040499181&usg=AOvVaw2Vv_enSFoBvIvwu6XrkPoJ)]

Encounter - Aquaveil Highlich:

- Description: These bony creatures radiate power, moving in stilted motions across the city in their eternal vigil.
- Default: Should they see the player, there will only be strife.
- Chase: Outspeeding this dead wizard bitch is an option, fly into the city and lose it in the narrow alleyways and passages. Athletics to do so.
- Patrol Patterns: They seem to follow some manner of pattern, they do not fly aimlessly. This can be exploited. Investigation, Animal Handling, or Survival to figure out the patrol pattern and fly through a blind spot.
- Consequence: If they attempted a skill check and it fails, a strife ensues.

Encounter - Aquaveil Vestige:

- Description: This city is abandoned, yet the door to the Duat is sealed with birds without and tripartite guardians within. Whatever the city hides, this bladed sentinel stands in the player's way.

- [[Optional theme for the Scene](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DX_pDwv3tpug&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040502792&usg=AOvVaw0rh-A3TG56mT55Pm4HCzdp)]

- Default: Should they see the player, the vestige will warn the player to turn back; Hell awaits beyond the threshold. If they do not take any other action, they will begin a strife.
- Stealth: The passage to the threshold of the Duat is a singular hallway, but the pillars and buttresses provide ceiling cover for a player no longer vertically constrained. Stealth check to bypass the guardian.
- Charm: The undead are not without intelligence, this one capable of speech and thought. Convince it with any Charisma skill of choice that the player can best what lies beyond, it will stand aside.
- Consequence: If they attempted a skill check and it fails, a strife ensues for the player's own good, so it says.

Gate - Underworld Gate:

- Gate: The gate is DC 25, but can be retried with a different approach, or retry the same approach with disadvantage.
- Locked (2): The passage into the Duat is sealed shut with the gold and blood of Dersite nobles who shed their mortal trappings to take on their holy duties. Chains and seals adorn the doors; both must be undone to unbar the way. Curiously, the pattern of the sigils are reminiscent not just of Sobek's nexus, but of Loki's runes, Janus' adornments, and unknown symbols besides.
- Chains of Gold: Not solid gold, sadly.

- Attack roll or Athletics to break the chains.
- Sleight of Hand or Engineering to unbind them.
- Discern skill to find the weakest link.
- Spend 1 AP to automatically pass.

- Sigils of Blood: Not fake blood, sadly.

- Psi skill or Occult to unbind them.
- Endurance, Medicine, or Sanity to endure the blowback.
- Investigation or Perception to unravel them by their creator's mark.
- Spend 1 AP to automatically pass.

- Consequences: If the player fails to undo the two obstacles a total of four times combined, everything unravels explosively and saps the player's vitality in the process.

Ordeal - Applause for the Fool:

- Crucible: The ordeal is DC 25 and is made at disadvantage.
- Last Chance: The threshold to the Duat is a black, inky thing of stars uncounted. Approaching it also wracks the player with incredible pain, as if to kill them now to spare them from worse fates than death, un and otherwise. The pain only abates with a display of prowess, asking the player to demonstrate their god tiered strength and prove their transfiguration into a configuration of Paradox Space has not stripped them of worth. Any skill check of choice will suffice.

- [[Optional theme for the Scene](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWYnT6huYhLw&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040509976&usg=AOvVaw15mwLhvvKNPOqXSIPoMPoH)]

Victory:

- Conclusion: The Duat is a singular path of smoothed marble beneath a starscape of millions of stars like gemstones against velvet. The Duat is a kaleidoscope of universes scoured by cosmic flame without boundary, the sacrifice made in grief and hope as the last age passed. The Duat is the resting place of the Prince of Life who never expected to see the player of the Fifth step through that gateway.

### ==> Chapter 5: Classpects and God Tiers

“Somewhere a zealous god threads these strings between the clouds and the earth...”

Developer’s Note (3/23/2020): While we could just repaste the prior edition’s stuff here, this is a topic we’ve stayed hands off on due to the community’s preference for a more freeform sub-system(s). That said, there are concerns that the systems might not mesh well with the updates. We’ll be revamping this section as the year of 2020 rolls on.

Developer’s Note (11/9/2020): And here we are, only several months after the fact, definitely not late at all. The classpect power system given below is deliberately open-ended, only stating its mechanical benefit while what it looks like and what actually transpires in-universe is left to you and the player to fill in. God Tiering also deliberately boosts their Demeanor and other choices they made all the way back at character creation to reinforce a sense of confidence and empowerment in the character and the choices that made them the way they are.

#### Classpects and God Tiers

Your players' characters will have a class and aspect just as in canon Homestuck! While they're free to express to you their thoughts and preferences about their characters' classpects, ultimately it is up to you as the SM what their classpect will be, and consequently should be kept a secret until their character finds out in-universe.

The [Classes and Aspects](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OZr213285x5OKXRhYr9nKepoted3Jn_lzGxmCeA3Svs/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040515807&usg=AOvVaw3doAVKPSmgCG4CR-psjOY3) document details the different classes and aspects as the RPGStuck community has historically used.

The interpretation of classes, aspects, and the bearing titles have on their players is one of the most subjective parts of Homestuck. That said, there are a few parts of the system that are generally agreed upon:

- The class describes what the player does to the aspect, which is an abstract and general concept.
- Classpect powers usually manifest at a gate, a dungeon, a certain level, or a meaningful character development.

Keep in mind two players with the same title may have entirely different power sets. For example, a Knight of Void, one who actively exploits Void, may have the ability to create miniature black holes, or can sneak into the Void to catch enemies by surprise. Both can be explained as exploiting Void in some way, yet come away with different abilities.

On the flip side, two players with different titles may have similar power sets. For example, a Knight of Hope, one who actively exploits Hope, might tap into it to manifest a sword made purely of Hope. A Mage of Breath, one who actively understands Breath, might tap into it to make their bullets fly true. Both of them utilize different aspects in different ways, but the end result of heightened combat prowess is shared by both.

##### Classpects

Classpects are a perennially complex discussion as to who is which classpect (especially why) and what a player should expect from it. Given there are 144 classpect combinations (master classes, which are a whole nother conversation, are not included in this count), RPGStuck has opted to use a one size fits all approach.

The following is a basic set of classpect abilities and rules that ought to get players through their session. You may add to it at your discretion (or replace it entirely with a system of your own making), but this is meant to be a baseline that can be adapted to just about any session's players.

Players should unlock these abilities at a narratively appropriate time, when it seems right that the player would start awakening to their latent powers. Moments of duress, or practice, or any examples from canon will suffice.

Aspect Points

Aspect Points are a resource equal to the player's Proficiency bonus by which they can leverage their aspect. They restore fully on a long rest. Their maximum AP increases by 1 per odd numbered gate completed (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th).

God Tiered players are able to restore 1 AP on a short rest.

AP should be reworded to fit the player's aspect, e.g. Breath players will use Breath Points, Light players have Light Points, etc.

Abilities

Players with access to their classpect start with the following two abilities:

- Empower: When the player makes an attack roll or skill check, they may spend 1 AP to roll with advantage. If making an attack roll, they add two d8 Aim dice. If making a skill check, they add two d8 Stakes dice. This can be used retroactively on a roll.

- The player should explain, in-character, how their aspect helps them.

- Afflatus: The player may spend 1 AP to ask a question about the scene, and the aspect answers back, in that aspect's unique way.

Players may unlock more abilities as they progress through their session, at narratively appropriate times: the conclusion of odd-numbered gates (like max AP increases) would be appropriate, if nothing else comes to mind.

Additional Abilities

Players ought to gain these at narratively appropriate times like odd-numbered gates (same as max AP increases), as said in the Primer. Not every player should get all of these abilities: not every player will have the same need for every ability, nor might their classpect or playstyle lend themselves to using them.

- Assault: The player may spend 1 AP to either reroll their damage dice at +2 die sizes or gain 50% bonus damage to the roll. This may be done once per round.

- The player should explain, in-character, how their aspect works toward this end.

- Preserve: The player may spend 1 AP to halve all incoming damage for 1 round. This may be done once per round.

- The player should explain, in-character, how their aspect helps them.

- Succor: The player may spend 1 AP to heal for half their highest stat or twice their Level, whichever is higher. This may be done once per round.

- The player should explain, in-character, how their aspect does this.

- Defy: The player may spend 1 AP and gain 1 Paradox to perform some miraculous feat that the aspect facilitates.

- The player should explain, in-character, what it is they intend to do.

- Freestyle: The player might spend 1 AP to perform some action through their aspect.

- The player should explain, in-character, what it is they want to do.
- Developer's Note (11/9/20): This is not so much an ability as it is a signal of sorts to you, the SM. When players consider Stakes and Flaws and what they can leverage to do something or make something possible to do at all, spending Aspect Points is on the table.

Paradox is a representation of the cost of reaching beyond their means and using their power in ways reserved for the god-tiered or those of a similarly empowered temperament. Players start at 0 Paradox. Accumulating 3 Paradox will have consequences, which is your cue as the SM to levy an aspect or narrative appropriate consequence for burning out.

For those reasons, Paradox is a wholly optional part of the classpect system; use it as a check on how often a player might leverage their power to do completely fantastical and over the top shenanigans, if you feel it necessary.

- Indefatigable: The player can short rest in up to 10 minutes instead of 1 hour, and can long rest within 1 hour instead of 8 hours.

- Developer's Note (11/17/20): Depending on the nature of your session, by the time the players can rest after god tiering, the events and the stakes of the session may have accelerated to a point that resting is simply infeasible, in-universe. If you expect everything to hit the fan very fast and all at once, give this to your players so they can keep going.

##### Details and Examples

Where abilities are concerned, the player has free reign to define how their aspect works, though you as SM have the final say on if what they intend matches what actually happens.

Afflatus and Defy are defined by you, the SM. Accordingly, make them as broad or as frequently usable as possible; this framework relies on only a few, broad, frequently used abilities.

Here are some examples:

- Vorwissenachsen (Afflatus, Mind): When deliberating on a choice, you may spend 1 MP to have it coalesce into a vision that presents you with the outcomes of that choice.

- Developer's Note (11/1/20): Terezi's powers from canon come to mind here.

- Introspective Induction (Afflatus, Light): You may spend 1 LP to present a body of facts and pose a conclusion based on those facts. Light shows you where your conclusion is insufficient, incomplete, or otherwise strange.

- Fulmination (Defy, Breath): You may spend 1 BP and gain 1 Paradox to command the winds to perform some miraculous task. It might move great obstacles via hurricane-strong winds, lay waste to an area with a tornado, or use the winds to ferry yourself great distances in short order.

- Developer's Note (11/1/20): John's powers from canon come to mind here.

- Cover Identity (Defy, Light): You may spend 1 LP and gain 1 Paradox to weave a false identity that you can put on and off at will. This false identity causes any who interact with you to see this false identity instead. You do not physically change in any way, but others' minds will bend where reasonable to rationalize any inconsistencies. Any false identities you create will persist to be called upon as you please unless you voluntarily dissolve them.

- Splendor (Defy, Void): You may spend 1 VP and gain 1 Paradox to briefly strip the non-existence from the formless Void, creating something that just so happens to perform some feat you want done.

- Developer's Note (11/1/20): Roxy's powers from canon come to mind here.

Similarly, you will want to rename these abilities to fit whatever themes or motifs your players have going for them.

##### God Tiers

God tiering is no small feat; it's the culmination of your player's journey in Sburb, after all.

Players automatically resurrect after 1d4 hours, given that their death was not Heroic or Just, regain 1 AP per short rest, and lose 1 Paradox per long rest if Paradox is being used. They also gain +1 maximum AP, and their Demeanor now grants them advantage.

- Developer's Note (11/1/20): Astute eyes will notice now both Demeanor and Empower grant advantage and two d8 bonus dice. This is intentional.

If players have not yet tried to claim their classpect can be leveraged for a Stakes die, they can do so now as their classpect begins to passively, minutely benefit them without the need for high and mighty miracles.

Furthermore, they gain two upgrades.

One is based on whether they are a psion/hybrid/martial.

- Psion: Gain two additional greater slots, gain the ability to spend 1 AP to regain one greater slot.

- Hybrid: Select three subpowers with lesser slot costs; these subpowers no longer spend lesser slots on use. Additionally, gain a new subpower: once per damage roll, spend one lesser slot to get +2 die sizes to damage (cannot choose this one to be free).

- If you don't know three subpowers when you gain this, you can retroactively apply this to newly learned subpowers in later levels.

- Martial: Once per turn, add your Level to a damage roll; if it the attack roll critically hits, add your Level again. Furthermore, you have +1 die size to all damage rolls (not just abilitechs or subpowers).

And the other is based on whether they are a slayer/sentinel/strategist.

- Slayer: Depends on their level 1 milestone choice.

- Dual Wielding: If both your major and minor actions are used to make damaging attacks, you may make a third attack as a free action that auto-hits for damage equal to half your Strength, Dexterity, or PCS.
- Combat Precision: Your bonuses from this improve to +2.
- Heavy Striker: Instead of adding 2P, add twice your Level.

- Sentinel: Gain +1 to AC/resistances. When you roll for hit points at each level (including retroactively), add +2 to the roll.

- Strategist: Gain a second minor action, but this minor action can only be used for actions that would activate Rapidity's effect. Rapidity always grants +3 to crit range.

There's also an alternative (replacing one of either kind) for players who don't see many strifes. Since these are gained at God Tiering, you should have a pretty good idea of whether a given player gets into them frequently, at that point.

- Alternative: If you have Expertise in a skill, any d6 Stakes dice are raised to d8s, and any d6 Flaws dice are lowered to d3s. When making a skill check, if the sum of your stat mod and skill points is not greater than your Proficiency, you gain +1 to the check per Polymath you possess.

It is worth mentioning that full sessions have completed with players doing few or even no strifes whatsoever.

#### Fraymotifs

Your players' characters might have fraymotifs available to them just as canon. What is a fraymotif? It's some sort of musical ability that players can use in a strife, whether it be a simple attack, aiding their allies, or something more esoteric.

Due to the dearth of information about fraymotifs in canon, RPGStuck uses the following to contextualize fraymotifs in-universe:

Paradox Space remembers the sum total of its occurrences across every session, alpha or doomed or otherwise. A fraymotif is a powerful memory of some specific incident considered heroic, insane, or otherwise noteworthy enough to leave a mark in Paradox Space's memory. From there, it ends up sold by consort shops, where players can draw on the memory in the same way they might draw on their aspect, replicating that memory. Typically to lay waste to their enemies.

Players should be held off from buying fraymotifs until after they've alchemized a full set of Tier 1 alchemy for themselves. They're potent little things, after all, but they're supplementary to the player's power, not the core focus.

Now, RPGStuck has dabbled with different forms of fraymotifs, and has cobbled together at least three different versions.

- The [current](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1KQUoZ-DIWRFM7UFMNKJ8-8YtLEMZ4s97wPtrcfb_Asg/edit&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040543852&usg=AOvVaw2lPiUjGl49p3QS9JDTozYC) version, 3.2, the current version with which RPGStuck intends to move ahead as of (fill in later). Unlike prior versions, they are premade, but are easier to comprehend for SMs and players alike.
- The [simplified](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q-z4INC5v85o9gDmj2zQzz3eyGrL_u0JQMR2cnjLjWc/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040544801&usg=AOvVaw0u-voU4sDNHcXbgvOIyh2u) version, 3.1, a simplified workshop where SMs can cobble together several types of fraymotifs dependant on utility.
- The [advanced](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UdwTGBaXExK51aOHn6aoh6pOefYfMdD5OmDc4YR59D8/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1730043040545635&usg=AOvVaw0puMmqN1AYmozVqJg1Rbob) version, 3.0, a very complex workshop through which ambitious SMs can come up with fine-tuned fraymotifs.

For the sake of simplicity, the assistant will instruct with the current version in mind.

Fraymotifs cost 1 AP and each fraymotif can only be used once per long rest. Consequently, the player will rarely get to use them; while the mechanical effect is set in stone (or not, as you see fit), what actually transpires in-universe is up to you and the player to fill in, just like the classpect abilities.

### ==> Chapter 6: Prototypings and Modifications

"Why do the imps look like Ben Stiller?"

#### The Basics

Prototyping occurs when a player must throw something into their sprite during the entry process. Among other things, the things thrown into their sprites affect how the underlings behave and act.

Prototyping encompasses a wide variety:

- Affinities, same as those of psionic powers, represent certain powers monsters might have as a result of their prototypings.
- Abilities, which are either new actions a monster can perform, or a modification of some action they can already perform.
- Traits, which changes something fundamental about the creature.

We don't have an official recommendation for how many prototyping effects you should have on your underlings. Instead, start with one or two, then work your way up until you feel comfortable with the underlings. That said, you can always throw in more or less if your players prototyped anything particularly benign or dangerous.

And you should always feel free to make up effects of your own.

##### Archetype

You might solidify a given monster's role in a strife by giving it an archetype.

- Berserker: This creature has advantage on all attacks and checks, has +2 crit range, and can Expose itself as a free action to gain advantage on all attacks and checks for 1 round.

#### Modifying Monsters

If you'd like to workshop monsters of your own, you can use the Bestiary Workshop tab in the SM Session Sheet to make it. If you'd like to see how the numbers are broken down though, this is the right place.

A monster's Tier determines its damage, HP, hit bonus, base defense, DC, and stat bonuses. It also determines their EXP and drops as well. Its damage, HP, and hit bonus are also different if the creature is a Horde, which works differently from a normal monster in two ways. Its damage output scales on its HP, and it is more vulnerable to area of effect abilities.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Base|   |   |   |Single|   |Horde|   |
|Tier|DC|Defense|HP|Damage|Hit Bonus|Damage|Hit Bonus|
|0|10|13|7|1|5|1|0|
|1|15|14|15|2|6|1|1|
|2|15|14|40|8|7|3|1|
|3|20|15|80|15|8|6|2|
|4|20|15|125|25|9|10|2|
|5|20|16|200|40|10|15|3|

The monster's damage, HP, and loot/EXP drops is then multiplied depending on its CR. Its CR is dependent on the template given to the creature.

The monsters' damage and HP are multiplied:

- Basic: Basics are CR 1. Damage, HP, and drops are unchanged.
- Lancer: Lancers are CR 2. It has 1.5x damage, 2x HP, 3x drops
- Glacier: Glaciers are CR 2. It has 1.25x damage, 2.5x HP, 3x drops
- Specialist: Specialists are CR 2. It has 1.75x damage and HP, 3x drops.
- Slayer: Slayers are CR 3. It has 2x damage, 3x HP, 6x drops.
- Adversary: Adversaries are CR 4. It has 2.5x damage, 4x HP, 10x drops.

And Hordes too, though they have a separate damage progression from singles:

- Horde: Hordes are CR 1. Damage, HP, and drops are unchanged.
- Mob: Mobs are CR 2. It has 2.67x damage, 3x HP, 3x drops.
- Swarm: Swarms are CR 3. It has 3.5x damage, 5.75x HP, 6x drops.
- Legion: Legions are CR 4. It has 4x damage, 9x HP, 10x drops.

A creature's damage mod is 40% of their base damage.

In general, the loot/EXP drop modifier remains the same. CR 1 is unchanged, CR 2 grants thrice the usual amount, CR 3 grants six times, and CR 4 grants ten times. This pattern can be extended to higher CRs, with fifteen for CR 5, twenty-one for CR 6, twenty-eight for CR 7, etc, though RPGStuck isn't balanced to scale that high for CR.

The monster blocks as presented in the Bestiary also optionally have some of the following modifications:

- Their HP is raised by 10% in exchange for -1 to AC/resistances (up to +30% max HP for -3 AC/resists), or lowered by 10% in exchange for +1 to AC/resistances (up to -30% max HP and +3 AC/resists).
- Their damage is raised by 20% in exchange for -2 to hit, or lowered by 20% for +2 to hit.
- They have Aegis (X), but reduce their max HP by X times their CR.
- Certain T1 creatures have lower damage than they ought so they don't paste low level players too easily.
- Each of their resistances can be modified by up to 2 in either direction (Reflex for a T4 creature might be low as 13 or high as 17). There is no mechanical conceit for balance for this, and is primarily done by vibes.
- They have +5 to initiative, or -5 to initiative. There is no mechanical conceit for balance for this, and is primarily done by vibes.

If creating an Adversary or Legion (boss blocks) for multiple players, give them 75% bonus HP per additional player (4 players would have 225% bonus HP, so a T5 Adversary would have 200 HP, then 4x HP for being an Adversary to 800 HP, then 225% bonus HP for 2600 HP total.)

Their damage remains constant, instead granting them the Rapid Action trait. Between two creatures' turns, the boss may perform a major action or move action. Any direct damage dealt or distance moved by a rapid action is halved. They may do this once per round per extra player (4 players would see the boss do this thrice a round.)

Developer's Note (2023-06-19): To be expanded with additional items as time goes on.

##### Challenges

A challenge refers to any special scripted action in a strife that comes in multiple forms.

The most common version is the Setpiece or the Sequence, wherein when an Adversary falls to half HP or less, the strife pauses and the player is called to make one or more skill check. These challenges incorporate some manner of fictional circumstance outside of a strife, such as a Denizen setting the world on fire, or the Black Queen using Red Miles. The skill check(s) represent the player's response to the Adversary's actions.

An example is provided below, assuming the Denizen to be the bearer of the challenge.

- Cataclysmic Setpiece: The Denizen flexes their strength as the player's final test by working a terrifying display of power that attempts to put the player down right then and there. The player must make a single skill check; any skill is allowed so long as the player can justify it, or come up with your own list of usable skills ahead of time. The consequences depend on the highest DC passed.

- None: This means the player got a total of 9 or less, and they either decided not to reroll or the dice gods have sentenced the player to pain unending. The player takes [base damage + 3 mods] damage.
- DC 10: The player doesn't fare too well and takes the brunt of the damage, but shouldn't one hit kill them. The player takes [base damage + 1 mod] damage.
- DC 20: The player mitigates most of the Denizen's power, taking relative scratch damage. The player takes [base damage - 1 mod] damage.
- DC 30: The player proves themselves the Denizen's equal, taking no damage whatsoever, then coming out renewed. The player takes no damage.
- DC 40/Crit: At SM's discretion, you can also grant the player advantage for the remainder of the phase/strife, refund AP, and/or other effects as desired, if they rolled a nat 20, rolled very, very high, or otherwise feel deserving of it.

- The Quicktime Sequence: The Denizen mixes up the strife, requiring the player to make two to four checks in sequence, a list of usable skills given for each check. The player takes true damage equal to the Denizen's damage mod per failed check, either all at the end or after each check as failed, whichever makes more sense in-universe. If all checks passed, the player takes advantage to attack rolls for the remainder of the phase/strife.

- Skirmish: A clash of blades, a display of prowess, a test of your reflexes.
- Enigma: A new unknown, a puzzle that must be solved, a complexity that portends danger if left unchecked.
- Seal: A barrier, an obstacle that must be overcome, a force that prevents progress until resolved.
- Desolation: A mental assault, a corrupting influence, resisting the mental flensing of one's mind and emotions.
- Agony: A physical agony, a pain or toxin or force, some incoming hurty thing that cannot be dodged, only endured.
- Rhetoric: An argument, a decisive retort, taking talking is a free action to its natural conclusion.
- Flight: A measured or messy retreat, a stealthy hunkering down, escaping approaching doom by any means.
- Pursuit: A chase scene, a search for the hidden, take Flight but be on the other side.

It may be easier to think of the Quicktime Sequence as… exactly that, a mid-fight QTE you might see in a video game.

These are intended to be used for Adversaries, but there's nothing stopping you from adding these to lesser CR enemies besides your judgment. Don't use them too often, or at least make them simplistic if used as such. A single skill check at half HP to see if the player can execute the creature in some fashionably flashy quicktime event wouldn't be amiss.

An alternate use for a Challenge is allowing mid-strife gambits. In this case, the player may initiate or continue a gambit at the start of each round, rolling once per round (or one exchange in the case of an opposed gambit).

An example is provided below, taken from Scenariostuck.

Challenge: The player may initiate a strife gambit or continue one at the start of each round, rolling once per round. This gambit is to either discern Minecraft Steve's fighting style using Investigation or Insight or some appropriate skill check, or wear down his will to fight with Insight or some Charisma check of choice. Players can perform multiple gambits over the course of the strife.

- Fighting Style: A gambit to discern his fighting style decreases his defenses by 4 on a success, or less on a partial. If failed, he raises his defenses by 2 as he wisens up.
- Break Will: A gambit to wear down his will forces a d6 Block die on all his rolls, or d3s on a partial. If failed, he gains a d3 Aim die on all his rolls as his resolve strengthens.

##### Adversary Traits

These are traits you might add onto an Adversary to make them even tougher. At your discretion, add them to non-adversaries too.

- Rising Danger: Some combatants cannot be fought in a battle of attrition. Whenever this creature misses an attack roll, it gains a stacking +2 bonus (to +6) until it lands an attack roll. Whenever this creature lands a non-crit attack roll, it gains a stacking +2 crit (to +6) until it lands an attack roll. Whenever this creature lands a critical hit, it imposes a stack of the condition Rising Danger; a creature with three stacks of Rising Danger is reduced to 0 hit points.
- Improved Grievous Wounds: This creature inflicts Grievous Wounds with certain attacks. This is a unique condition; when it reaches two stacks, it resets and the target takes 2*Level true damage. Lasts until a short rest.
- Blood Moon: If Grievous Wounds reaches max stacks and resets, dealing damage to the player (or other target), this creature has +1 damage mod on all attacks.
- Legendary Attacker: Whenever this creature would attack at advantage, they instead make two attacks without it. If they would make it at double advantage, they instead make three attacks without it.
- Companion: This creature is accompanied by a companion that occupies the same square. It has a single minor action on each of the creature's turns with which it may Aim, Avert, Assail, Distract, or Discern for them. It shares the same AC/resistances and has no HP, but is Incapacitated (2 rounds) if hit.
- Paradox Possibility: Once per round, this creature takes advantage on a d20 roll.

### ==> Chapter 7: Alchemy and Items

"I feel like this shouldn’t be as difficult as we’ve made it out to be."

#### Introduction

Alchemy is a process by which items are duplicated and/or combined to create new items. It serves an important role in entry, and throughout the entire game, and is one of the bigger draws of RPGStuck as a system.

There are two separate concepts to tackle: the physical process of alchemy in the session, and the purpose of alchemy from an SM’s viewpoint.

The actual process of alchemy requires checking the code on the back of a captchalogue card with the item, putting a spare card into the punch designix with the card, and punching the card with the code. This punched card is then put into a totem lathe with a cruxite dowel to carve the totem. This totem is then placed on the alchemiter, and it produces the item at the cost of grist, the tier of the item dependent on the tier of grist spent.

In practice, the process tends to be hand-waved, skipping directly to combining items for alchemy with the preceding processes assumed off-screen.

There are two ways to combine when alchemizing, && and ||.

- X && Y, or X AND Y for those familiar with computer programming, combines the form and function of X and Y.
- X || Y, or X OR Y, retains the function of X or Y, but keeps the form of the other, Y or X.
- X && Y || Z, or X AND Y OR Z, combines the form and function of X and Y, then keeps its form or function while Z takes the other, the function or form.

Then there is the purpose of alchemy from outside the in-universe perspective, which is to improve a player’s gear and increase their overall power. This is a simple concept that belies an open-ended problem, which will be explored further in the next section.

As the SM, alchemy is in your hands to do with as you please, both a power and a burden. You determine what a given alchemy combination does, with all its effects and limitations.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Grist Cost Tables|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Tier|T0|T1|T2|T3|T4|T5|
|0|30||||||
|1|60|30|||||
|2|180|60|30||||
|3|870|180|60|30|||
|4|1800|870|180|60|30||
|5|3100|1200|325|125|45|22|
|Notes: Accessories and non-equipped items come at half the cost.<br><br>T0: Build grist, the base tier 0 material, is highlighted because items typically cost only build grist (for mundane items and the like), or cost tiered grist but no T0 (tiered alchemy).|   |   |   |   |   |   |

Instead of describing specific items, this document aims to list Tags instead, which denote a particular effect. Instead of creating specific items, you instead create items that happen to fit the effects of all the tags.

For example, a psi focus is listed as a tag under the psionics category. Foci can take all sorts of shapes, but they all serve a common function.

Some tags will have an indented entry for higher tiers. These entries will list suggestions for how to improve the tag; we recommend taking one of the suggestions (not all of them) as sufficient for an upgrade, though you have the final say.

#### Utility Tags

Here is a list of utility tags, organized by function.

Utility tags are assumed to be Tier 0 and therefore cost only Build Grist. If the tag is recommended to be built with tiered grist, it will specify so in the tag's name.

Alchemy with utility tags typically will not produce weapons or wardrobes (with the rare exception for a psi foci). Therefore, all items here cost half the amount listed in the grist costs table.

Rarely, they will specify the item should cost extra (such as a car). In this case, apply the multiplier after halving the cost first.

Or they specify multiples (such as small cameras). In this case, the usual cost will create as many as listed in the multiple.

##### Stealth

The Stealth tag denotes items and effects that allow one to act without being detected.

- Disguise (T0): Disguise some part of yourself. Choose one:

#### Combat Tags

Here is a list of combat tags, organized by how they enhance a player's ability to throw down.

Combat tags are assumed to cost tiered grist, as they typically go on alchemized weapons, wardrobe, and accessories. Therefore, they will have a baseline tier associated with them.

You can always throw on multiple tags to approximate a higher tier tag. For example, if you want to create a T3 item, you can slap three T1 tags together and call it a day. If you want to create a T4 item, you can use four T1 tags, two T2 tags, a T2 tag and two T1 tags, a T3 tag and T1 tag, etc.

There are also legendary tags for alchemy made with the Denizen's grist hoard in preparation for the endgame. You can approximate them by doubling their tier, so a T4 tag would approximate a T2 Legendary.

That said, we do not recommend reverse-engineering this, having a T1 Legendary substitute for a T2 tag. These are meant for the endgame and are disproportionately powerful to have.

- Any tags indented below a legendary is meant for accessories to supplement the original legendary tag.

If a given tag specifies a given specibus, or power, or specific abilitechs/subpowers, it will be listed in its name. You are free to take the tag and apply it to other specibi or powers anyway, though adapting it is left up to you.

Developer's Note (02/28/2022): This is still a work in progress; you might be asking why we haven't organized them according to specibi or powers. The answer is that we don't have enough tags to warrant that. If we get enough we'll do it in the future, but for now, ctrl+f to search by specific terms.

##### Extra Abilitechs/Subpowers

The Extra Abilitech/Subpowers tag denotes items and effects that add additional abilitechs and subpowers that can be used.

- Unwieldy Obstruction (T1): The weapon or focus becomes physically large or obstructive enough to allow a reaction to impose -2 to one attack roll targeting AC.

- Return To Sender (Thrown tag, Throw T1): Reaction: After making a ranged attack with this abilitech, repeat the attack as it comes back for a second go. This deals half damage. If the abilitech allows +1 die size if the ranged abilitech is made as a melee attack, add that +1 die size when using this reaction.

- To Whom it May Concern (T1): The projectile explodes. It now targets Reflex but hits everyone within a 10 ft. radius of the target.
- Reply All (T1): The projectile is electrified, or otherwise creates a danger zone within a 5 ft. radius of its space where it lands; anyone who begins their turn or enters the area takes half damage.

- Bolas Arrow (Bowkind T1): Taser Arrow, but the abilitech Prones the target instead. When knocked prone in this way, the target must also use a minor action, or use their full speed instead of half, to get up.

- Dual Bolas (T2): Hit two targets within 10 feet of each other and knock them both prone, neither can move until both targets are up. An object can be substituted in place of a creature but the object will not be knocked prone.

- Color Guard (Paintbllkind T1): Unbalance abilitech, but it instead imposes disadvantage on Stealth and grants attacks against them +2 to hit for 1 minute.
- Setplay Shot (Double tag T1): Basic abilitech, but it deals no damage. Instead, until the end of your next turn, successive abilitechs with the same specibus have a rising +1 die size, up to +6 die sizes.

Pyrokinesis

- Accelerant (T1): Ash Cloud (lesser), but it instead douses the air with accelerants for 1 minute. Any creatures that move into this terrain are doused with them even if they move out; the accelerants impose Lethal (2P) and extend any condition inflicted by a Pyrokinesis subpower by 1 round.
- Fire Lash (T1): Spend a lesser slot when grappling as a major action to inflict Pd3+PCM damage on a successful grapple. They can then repeat this as a minor action without slot cost on subsequent turns to repeat the damage automatically as long as the grapple lasts.
- Hearthfire (T1): You empower your affinity to create a healing fire while resting. When taking a short rest, spend a lesser slot. You and those short resting with you can add +2 to hit die rolls for healing.
- Midnight Candle (T1): You Ignite (at-will) yourself instead, but Flame instead damages all other targets within range when it would damage you.

Anatomy/Called Shots

Alchemy for targeting anatomy.

- Bloodwork (T1): Whenever you land an attack when targeting an Artery or similar anatomy, you can do one of the following:

- Exsanguinate: When you destroy an Artery, you inflict two DoTs instead of one.
- Pale Rider: When you destroy an Artery, its DoT also racks up Lethal that stacks to thrice the DoT's magnitude.
- Fountain: When you destroy an Artery and that target dies, it deals damage equal to twice the DoT's magnitude to all enemies within 15 feet, and heals you and allies for half the amount.
- Verge of Death: When you destroy an Artery, you can trade the DoT for a +4 crit range on all attack rolls against the target that cannot be removed by healing or skill checks.
- Thanatophobia: The DoT also imposes Setback (2).

- Raze and Ruin: Every time you land an attack against an Opening, you inflict Fade (1) and Sunder (1), stacking to 3 each.
- Distance: If you are aware of an Opening on a target, you may flip it and impose -2 on their attack rolls against you until you target that Opening.

- Breakpoint (T1): Whenever you land an attack when targeting a Shatterpoint or similar anatomy, you can do one of the following:

- Battering Rams: You add +2 to the crit range bonus.
- Siege Expert: Whenever you critically hit against the Shatterpoint, you may also Break, Clip, or Disrupt them for 1 round, of your choice.
- Collateral Damage: When you critically hit a Shatterpoint, take half the damage done before the crit's damage bonus; this is dealt to all other enemies within 15 feet too.
- Crunch of Glass: Your critical hits against Shatterpoints trade out Daze for Impair for the same duration.
- Shattered Bones: Inflict Lethal (Lvl) on any attacks landed against Shatterpoints.
- Fisher's Paradise: If you have +4 to hit from claiming double advantage, you can claim it to crit range as well when targeting Shatterpoints.

- Malicious Shots (T1): Whenever you land an attack when targeting a Vitals or similar anatomy, you can do one of the following:

- Kidney Shot: Your attacks against Vitals trade the Daze effect for Exposing the target until the end of your next round.
- Weakened Constitution: Whenever you land an attack against Vitals, choose one condition on the target or inflicted by that attack: extend it by 1 round.
- By the Throat: Whenever you grapple a target's Vitals, you have +3 to crit against them.
- Overwhelming Force: When you land attacks against the Vitals and it would cause the target to have more than two instances of Daze at once, raise the crit range and damage size by +1 per additional instance of Daze.

##### Abilitech/Subpower Tweaks

The Abilitech/Subpower Tweaks tag denotes items and effects that modify an existing specibus and/or power.

- Heavy Mode/Overtuned (T1): The specibus/focus has +1 die size on all damage rolls, but if the attack roll has any Block dice, it gains an additional die of the highest one.
- Life on the Edge (T1): Whenever this specibus or focus inflicts Rupture, it also inflicts Lethal of the same magnitude.
- Hair Trigger (T2): Once per strife, when you miss a target with your attack roll, you may choose not to make the attack, refunding the action that would've been used to make it, but you cannot make another damage-dealing action with this refunded action. No resources are spent on the action, and any abilities that would've been wasted on the failed attack roll (such as Enhance! or Hold Breath) carry over to your next attack roll.
- Skill Issue (T2): Once per strife, when you make a skill check during a strife and it fails to beat another skill check or a resistance, you may choose to forego the action, refunding the action cost, but you cannot reattempt another skill check with that refunded action. No resources are spent on the action, and any abilities that would've been wasted on the failed attack roll (such as Heroic Pose or As a Team!) carry over to your next skill check.
- Pinning Charge (Dive, Flying Kick, Haymaker T1): These abilitechs also impose a condition for 1 round. Pick any one condition the specibus is capable of inflicting, or Clipped, or Impaired.

- Pressed Assault (T1): Your next abilitech has either +2 die sizes or extends its conditions' duration by 1 round.

- Buzzsaw (Spree, Hack and Slash, Reap, Charge, Roadkill T1): These abilitechs instead make two attacks at disadvantage against each target instead. If both against a target hit, you make a third that automatically hits for half damage.

- Circular Momentum (T1): You may harness the momentum on your following turn; either your next melee attack may hit all targets within range, or you may move half your base speed as a free action.

- Extra Ordinance 1 (Bombkind T1): When using a Bombkind abilitech, you can decrease cache by 1 to make it hit all targets within 10 feet (or increase radius by 10 feet), extend the duration of its condition by 1 round (or environmental effect for 1 minute), or add +1 die size to damage.
- Extra Ordnance 2 (Bombkind T1): When using a Bombkind abilitech, you can decrease cache by 1 to deal half damage on miss, push all targets 20 feet, Impair all targets in the environmental effect, or deal +50% damage on a crit.
- Auld Lang Syne (Fncysntakind T1): If you use Letters to Santa while you already have three charges, the spirit of Christmas is so overwhelming that you cause an explosion centered on yourself, dealing Qd3+STR damage to all targets within 15 feet and Q damage to yourself.

- Overflowing Cheer (T1): Track excess charges. If you get four excess charges, you immediately use an abilitech that expends 3 charges for half damage as part of the same minor action, then take half again damage to yourself, and go to 3 charges and no excess.

##### Defensives

The Defensive tag denotes items and effects that provides defensive, protective, and other harm reduction effects.

- Deployable Shield (T1): A device that extends into a standing shield that can be used as a 10 ft. long piece of half cover for +2 to AC/Reflex. Alternately, it serves as a fully-covered, transparent wall up to 10 feet long.

- Higher Tiers: The shield also grants Aegis, can move with the player, can be detonated as a trap that damages enemies and lets players fly away from the momentum.

- Ice Block (Cryokinesis T1): When you would hit 0 HP, you instead go to 1 HP and encase yourself in ice, putting yourself in Stasis until the ice block around you is broken, 1 hour passes, or until you come out as a free action. This can be done once per long rest, but can be refreshed earlier with two lesser slots as a full-round action. The ice block has AC/resistances of 10 and 50 HP.
- Holistic Infusion (Radiokinesis T1): When you hit 0 HP, you then immediately heal for Pd6+PCM hit points and return to the fight. This can be done once per long rest, but can be refreshed earlier with two lesser slots as a full-round action.

##### Friendly Utility

The Friendly Utility tag denotes items and effects that grants combat benefits to the player or their allies.

- Crippling Strike (T1): Once per short rest, you may throw… something, at an enemy as part of rolling for initiative, rendering them Stuck until the end of their next turn. Cannot be used if surprised.
- Oops! Dropped It! (T1): When rolling for initiative, you may drop… something, at a point within half your base speed. This creates a 5 ft. radius of difficult terrain that lasts for the duration of the strife. Cannot be used if surprised.
- Offscreen Fan (T1): Once per short rest, you may do… something, making an Intimidation or Performance check against all targets as part of rolling for initiative, targeting Will resistance. For each target, if you break resistance, they are Dazed for 1 round. Cannot be used if surprised.

- PRESENTATION!!! (T2): For each target, you may choose between Dazing them for 2 rounds, 2xDazing them for 1 round, or Impairing them for 1 round.

RPGStuck Gift Shop

Alchemy that brings back mechanics from Second Edition, for good or for ill. Probably for ill, since rpgstuck-chan gets paid by commission.

- RPGStuck Gift Shop Memento: Fusilier (T1): You have three Cartridges that replenish on a short rest. You may expend one to perform one of the following as a free action:

- Blast Shot: Your next ranged attack knocks the target Prone.
- Clipping Shot: Your missed ranged attack still deals any bonus damage (anything besides the base damage roll before stat mods) that the attack would've landed if it hit.
- Show of Force: Your ranged attack deals no damage but it targets Will resistance instead. If it breaks resistance, the target is Exposed until the end of your next turn. Either way, for the same duration, they are also Clipped and you have advantage on your ranged attack rolls against them.

- RPGStuck Gift Shop Memento: Item Aura (T1): You have a sticker that you can put on an item; switching to and from this item is a free action instead of a minor action.
- RPGStuck Gift Shop Memento: Pack Tactics (T1): Allies who make attacks while within 10 feet of you have +1 die size to their damage rolls.

##### Path Tweaks

The Path Tweaks tag denotes items and effects that modify Steps for a player.

- Make an attack (using your stats) against AC for Pd3+PCM damage.
- When you land a single-target attack, deal an additional Pd3 damage.

- You can dissemble the construct as a minor action, with any HP refunded to your ward. While active, your construct counts as your ward for the purposes of Steps and other synergies (such as Mind Spike), and you can draw your block radius from the ward.

- Palace of the Mind (T1): After being attacked by an enemy, you are able to accurately remember any tendencies or habits that they have whilst fighting, storing them within your ward to fortify it. As a free action once per round, you may add an enemy into your Mind Palace and gain select bonuses when fighting against them, depending on where in your palace you sent them. You may also do this if you successfully Discern a target in a strife.

- The Dungeon: Enemies in your Mind Palace are locked away in the dark depths of your mind’s dungeon. Once per round as a reaction, when an enemy damages your ward, make an Endurance check, targeting their Will resistance. If you break resistance, inflict Setback (2). If you're using a reaction to impose Block dice on an incoming attack, you may do this as part of that reaction.

- The Ballroom: Let’s dance! When an enemy is in your Mind Palace, you can bend them to your whims! While your ward is active, you have +2 to hit any enemies in your palace. If it has no hit points, but your attack would regenerate it (say, it expends a slot), it can claim the hit bonus.

- Ars Memorativa (T1): Once per round as a free action, you can Discern an enemy in your mind palace, with advantage on the check.
- Damnatio Memoriae (T1): Instead of adding an enemy into your Mind Palace, you may instead take an enemy already in the dungeon and send them to the guillotine! You may use a minor action to activate the guillotine, inflicting Lethal (3P), though they then exit the palace in pieces.

- Paladin's Aura (T1): While within the Custodian Stance, if an ally within block radius has a resistance targeted, and your resistance is higher than theirs, they may use yours instead.
- Blue Diamond Certified (T1): You gain an extra reaction per turn that can only be used for the Bodyguard reaction. Additionally, you can move half your base speed before or after redirecting the attack as part of the reaction.

- Paranoia Agent (T1): Memetic Agent can have its Impair switched out with 2xDazed, Exposed or Stuck for the same duration.

- Saboteur (T1): When you Assail as a minor action, you can instead target an enemy and Weaken them for 1 round.
- Opening Hand (T1): As part of rolling for initiative, select a target with a lower initiative roll than you; they immediately take Pd3 damage as a retroactively justified and prepared attack harms them. This is a basic abilitech and at-will subpower.
- Master of Stratagems (T1): You replace Master of Tactics with Master of Stratagems: in addition to all effects, you gain a set of four Orders. You may give an Order at the start of each round to last for that round, and each Order may be given once per strife.

- Reposition!: You and each ally may immediately move half their respective base speeds.

Adherent/Allegro

- Aggravation (T1): When you add your Level to damage via Motes of Power or reset your stacks of Agitato, gain 1 stack of Aggravation. You can expend 1 stack of Aggravation to reroll damage with +1 die size, including the same damage roll that ultimately gave you the stack to begin with. Aggravation stacks to 3 and can be used for other purposes:

- Deranged Channeling (T1): Spend 1 stack on hit roll of 17-20 on the d20 when using Unfettered Channeling to explode, but placing it on the target (or center if AoE) instead of yourself.
- Accelerated Catalysis (T1): Spend 1 stack to make Catalytic Brand start at Sunder (3), and the next lesser slot usage raises it to Sunder (6).
- Greater Amoroso (T1): Spend 1 stack when using Amoroso to make it a separate attack with Pd8 base damage that automatically hits. Then give it +1 die size and count as an abilitech and/or subpower for any other effects that synergize with them.
- Acceso Redux (T1): Spend 1 stack when benefitting from Acceso to increase the Rupture's value by 2P.

Artillery

- Bombardier Stance (T1): As a free action, you may enter the Bombardier Stance. While you are in this stance, your base speed is reduced to 5 feet, but you ignore the prone/non-moved requirements for Prone Position, Steady Aim, and One in the Hand. Furthermore, if there are no enemies within 30 feet since the end of your last turn, you gain +1 die size to all ranged damage rolls.

- Mobile Artillery (T1): Twice per strife, you ignore the base speed reduction for 1 round.

- Multi-Tasker (T1): You can Half-Trace as a full-round action, half-tracing two targets at once, or half-trace one target and keep the ability to put one on a different target as a free action at any point within the next 1 minute. Half-trace works the same as trace, but two targets may be half-traced at once, your next successful attack against a half-traced target deals 50% bonus damage rather than 100%, and everything that specifies a traced target (Trigonometry, Vital-Point Targeting, etc) works on both targets.

- Master Tracking (T1): Advanced Tracking can claim both +1 die size to all Aim dice and one d6 Aim die (which becomes d8).
- Target Balance (T1): When you half-trace two targets at the same time, if either one is Blind, Dazed, Deafened, Faded, Ruptured, Setback, or Sundered, you transfer them to the other, with the same durations as their original.
- Target Equilibrium (T1): When you land damaging attacks against a half-traced target, the other half-traced target takes damage equal to a stat mod of choice.

- Greater Trace (T2): When you Trace a target, after your +100% bonus damage is used, your next attack against the Traced target gets +50% bonus damage.
- The Network Backbone (T2 Legendary): When you Trace a target, you may trace a secondary and tertiary target. Whenever you deal damage to the primary Trace, you deal half that damage to the secondary, and half again to the tertiary. Whenever one of these traced targets die, you may Trace a new target as a free action (but do not gain the +100% damage bonus) and rearrange the primary/secondary/tertiary designations among the three as desired.

- Fire Priority: You have a pool of six d4 Aim dice per round that can be used as desired on any attack against the designated targets. You can spend two dice to get two d6 Aim die, or spend one die to add +1 size to an existing Aim die.
- Overlapping Fire: Whenever you benefit from Assail or deal stat mod damage onto a designated target, that damage is mirrored to the other designated targets.

Mystic

- Radiant Chains (T1): Anchor of Light can target two creatures instead, if both are within 30 feet of each other. They are instead tethered to each other for 2 rounds, but when you cast the chains you may dictate if the two targets must be 10 feet or closer, or 40 feet or further. At the end of each tethered creature's turn, if this condition is unmet, both of them take Pd3+PCM damage. You may tether one end to an object, an ally, or yourself; in this case, only the other target takes this damage when the condition is unmet (initiative 0 for objects).
- Midnight Hour (T1): Whenever you impose conditions that benefit from Witching Hour, if you made a skill check to do so, check if it would have crit were it an attack roll. If it did, as well as attack rolls that actually crit, you may also impose Expose, Impair, or Stuck for 1 round, of your choice, or increase the duration of an extended effect by another 1 round.
- Thorned Silver (T1): When you use Cursed Mirror, instead of transferring P damage to the target, you instead make the next 4 times you take damage transfer P damage to the attacker.
- Leviathan's Consumption (T1): Whenever a target heals from Leviathan's Maw, the marked target takes the healed amount as damage.
- Improved Runic Warding (T1): Runic Warding loses its clause preventing allies from benefiting from Aegis (P) for 1 round after having it.

- Stake of Light (T2): Anchor of Light is instead placed within 60 feet and targets everyone within a 10 ft. radius instead.
- Grasp of Light (T2): Anchor of Light can be used against a grappled target; they are unable to attempt a check to escape the grapple until the anchor is broken, with all the damage it entails.

- Moon Runes: When you apply the benefits of Runic Warding to an ally by any means, you may use Shadow Ops for the ally, conferring its effects to them instead.

Abraxas

- Massive Attack (T1): Spend a second lesser slot when using Open Floor Samba as part of rolling for initiative to make the attack rolls and the initiative roll at advantage.
- Teardrop Express (T1): Railbird no longer costs you a reaction and additionally steals the target's reaction as well.
- Falling Angel Semiosis (T2): Sinclair's Psychic Avenger hits every target of choice within 50 feet instead, including the target of the original crit that activated it.

- Improvisation (T1): Once per strife, when you spend DP but fail to break resistance with the action that spent it (does not apply to All Eyes on Me or any DP move that doesn't target a resistance), you refund the DP cost. Alternately, you may spend 1 DP to reroll the check.

Infernal

- Kraken's Might (T1): Spend a reaction when landing a single-target attack to add the Opportunist damage to the damage roll.

Tactician/Vanguard

- Recoupment (T1): Loss Prevention also works the other way; when you place temporary hit points on an ally through a resource (slots, etc) and temp HP expires on that ally instead of being used (whether or not all of that temp HP came from you, only some), up to P temp HP becomes hit points instead. Excess healing from this cannot proc Loss Prevention.
- Adloquium (T1): When using Triage Protocols, you can forego the +2 die sizes or +2P healing bonus to grant temp HP equal to the original healed amount. This temp HP stacks with others. If you would add twice your Level to the heal, increase the temp HP by that much too.

- Splotches of Crimson (T1): Wreath of Higanbanas additionally confers Regen (P, 3 rounds) on the target.

- Retrieve Arms (T1): When you land a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you may leave the weapon in the target; you can retrieve it as a major action, repeating that abilitech with +1 die size but as a melee attack.

Keystones

This is a miscellaneous section for keystone path alchemy that had one or two good ideas but not enough to warrant its own section.

- Bloody Glass (T1): After a rest, you can choose to reduce max HP by your Level to boost Berserker Stance by another +1 die size at half HP or less, for as long as the max HP reduction remains.

- Purgation (T1): Expend a Dream as a free action to create a 30 ft. radius sphere of fire centered on yourself for 1 minute; all enemies of your choice within it count this as difficult terrain, and take P damage if they start their turn or enter the area. This counts as an abilitech and subpower for the purposes of synergy with other Steps and effects.
- Our Lady of Cleansing Flame (T1): Once per strife, when you are critically hit or would be reduced to 0 HP, resolve it; you regain 1 HP and one Dream afterwards.

#### Higher Tier Preset Alchemies

For players who want to start at higher levels, they'll also want to start with alchemized gear to compensate.

We recommend starting them off at the first level of whichever tier of play they want to start in, and giving them a full complement of alchemy from the preceding tier. For example, players who want to start at level 5 at Tier 2 should have alchemy from Tier 1, just as they would have if they started at level 1 and got to level 5.

##### Level 5 Start (Tier 2)

Players starting at level 5 will have two Steps and their level 5 specialization. It's also entirely possible they have the max of 20 in a stat of their choosing.

We recommend the following alchemized gear for them:

Specibus/Focus:

- Weathered Tool: You may reroll 1s on your damage roll. If you can already do this, you instead add +1 to each die instead.

Wardrobe:

- Saving Grace: Once per short rest, when you are critically hit or reduced to 0 hit points, you heal for Pd4 hit points after calculating and taking damage, but before you would pass out, die, or whatever the narration dictates.

Accessories:

- Packed Lunch: Whenever you heal from rolling hit dice, you add +1 to each die.
- Sharp Crystal: Whenever you can claim flat hit bonuses on an attack roll, you also have +1 to crit for every +2 to hit.

The following start will fit most needs for alchemy for someone starting Tier 2. However, we recommend talking with your player and switching them out for more specific items to suit their build. For example, the following might be the starting alchemy for a T2 player with scythekind and Steps from Dancer.

Specibus/Focus:

- Harvest Moon (Buzzsaw): Reap makes two attacks at disadvantage against each target instead. If both against a target hit, you make a third that automatically hits for half damage.

Wardrobe:

- Aesthete's Veil (Khachaturian's Encore): For each Step in Dancer, gain 2 Dancer Points (DP) that regen on a short rest. Provocative Dance and Marin Karin cost 2 DP, while Feign Surrender, Wait Your Turn, and All Eyes on Me cost 1 DP. These Steps then lose their rest/strife-limited uses.

- You can Flourish as a major action to pose dramatically and gain 2 DP, but any DP gained this way are lost at the end of the strife. They then gain one of the following:
- Whenever you spend DP in a strife, all enemies in the strife gain Lethal (P) per 1 DP spent, stacking up to Lethal (6P).

Accessories:

- Butterfly Charm (Improvisation): Once per strife, when you spend DP but fail to break resistance with the action that spent it (does not apply to All Eyes on Me or any DP move that doesn't target a resistance), you refund the DP cost. Alternately, you may spend 1 DP to reroll the check.
- Silver Skull Keychain (Buzzsaw Extra): After using Reap, you may harness the momentum on your following turn; either your next melee attack may hit all targets within range, or you may move half your base speed as a free action.

##### Scenariostuck Premades

Alchemy premade for 3e Scenariostuck since removed in favor of a simpler, uniform progression are listed here, split into tier 1 and tier 2.

However, keep in mind that Scenariostuck balanced its alchemy differently; it chose one item from the list to use as an accessory, but did not have separate effects for specibus/focus and wardrobe. Each effect in the list has as much power as a specibus/focus effect, wardrobe effect, and accessory effect combined, for that given tier.

Tier 1:

- Tojo Clan Pin (grapplers): Any targets you grapple are considered Ruptured (2, duration of grapple). When you use any abilities that need a grappled target, or calls for an Athletics check, add 3 damage to any damage it deals. If they deal no damage, they Daze (1 round) instead.

- Sekhmet's Intonation (heavy-hitting bruisers): At the start of a strife, add up your skill points in any two of Athletics, Endurance, psi skill, and Intimidation; you have this as temp HP that stacks with other temp HP.

- Echo Edge (combo attackers): At the end of each turn, gain 3 points per damaging attack you landed that turn, up to 9 points per turn. You can turn these points to temp HP that lasts 1 round or a damage bonus to your next two attacks, dividing between the two as you wish.

- Traceur's Stopwatch (phys strategists): In a strife, you gain a Reprisal meter that starts at 0 and goes to 5. You add 1 to this gauge whenever you pass a skill check or each time your STR or DEX mods are invoked when using a Step. You add 2 instead if you passed a Strength or Dexterity skill check. When the meter is full, you can reset it as a free action to make your next landed attack deal +100% damage.

- Knight's Gunblade Polish (martial hybrids): Whenever you land a damaging abilitech or subpower, make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma skill check, skill of your choosing; if this roll would also hit, the damage roll gains +1 die size and extend the duration of any conditions inflicted by 1 round. If the check would miss, you must choose which one of the two effects you apply.
- Disarticulate's Butter Knife (psi hybrids): Whenever you use an abilitech against a target with one or more conditions you inflicted, or conditions that expired on your turn, you can roll and treat it as if it were a psionic attack, and gain +2 to hit for each such condition (up to +6). If you land this abilitech, you heal for 7 HP and your next damaging subpower has half the hit bonus as both hit and damage bonuses.
- Signed Copy of Diamond is Unbreakable (support psions): In a strife, when rolling for initiative, you summon a Realized Thoughtform, a Medium creature with 30 HP and 15 AC/resistances. It has a range of 5 feet, has 40 ft. speed, and +5 for any skill checks. It moves and acts as you will it, without an action cost, able to make a ranged (30 ft.) psionic attack (your psi attack bonuses) against a target's AC, dealing Pd3+PCM damage on a hit, with a control range of 50 ft. You can Help this minion regardless of its distance, and Helping it also grants +5 dice sizes to damage. Whenever this minion benefits from Aim dice, Block dice, or damage bonuses from you, it can either heal for 3 hit points or deal an additional 3 damage.

- Old Conductor's Baton (thaumaturge): Once per strife, a free action, you may turn Invisible, then teleport your base speed in any direction. The Invisibility lasts until you use a damaging ability or the end of your next turn, and said damaging ability has +1 die size. You may do this as a reaction to a damaging attack; doing so also halves the damage of the triggering attack.

Tier 2:

- Cena's Seal of Approval (grapplers): Whenever you use a minor action that specifies grappled targets, you perform two of them. Targets you grapple are considered Exposed for the duration.
- Karkellan Mind-Eater's Teddy Bear (psi-grappler): Whenever you make a psionic attack against a target you are grappling, you heal for 5 damage and inflict DoT (5, duration of strife) on them.
- Yiazmat's Memento (heavy-hitting bruisers): You have Ward equal to the highest skill points among Athletics, Endurance, psi skill, and Intimidation. As a reaction to an incoming attack roll, you may move 15 feet and gain +15 damage to your next damage roll.
- Reverb Nation Flag (combo attackers): At the end of each turn, gain 4 points per damaging attack you made that turn, up to 16 points per turn. You can turn these points to temp HP that lasts 1 round or a damage bonus to your next two attacks, dividing between the two as you wish.
- Choir Path Testing Kit (psi snipers): When you Defend, you can replace imposing disadvantage on incoming attacks for 1 round with gaining advantage and forcing half damage on miss (or full damage if the attack would already do this) to all outgoing damaging attacks until the end of your next round.

If the Aegis doesn't get used, you may Rupture the target for that magnitude instead. Additionally, your Block dice have a floor of 3; any Block dice that roll less than 3 count as 3.
- Ivory Chess Piece (psi sentinels): Whenever you expend a lesser slot, all enemies in the strife take 10 true damage and any two of the following: Weakened (1 round), Dazed (1 round), Impaired (1 round), Prone, Stasis (2 rounds), Sundered (1, stacks to 4), Faded (1, stacks to 4).
- Tattletale's BFF List (INT strategists): In a strife, you gain a Breakthrough meter that starts at 0 and goes to 5.

- Saint's Fridge Crowbar (phys strategists): In a strife, you gain a Reprisal meter that starts at 0 and goes to 5. You add 1 to this gauge whenever you pass a skill check or each time your STR or DEX mods are invoked when using a Step. You add 2 instead if you passed a Strength or Dexterity skill check.

- Black Wolf's Stalking Music (martial hybrids): Whenever you make a damaging abilitech or subpower, make a psi skill check. If this check would also hit, an echo repeats the abilitech or subpower for either half damage or inflict one condition from it for 2 rounds. Whenever you spend a lesser slot in a strife, your next attack roll has advantage.
- Sibilant's Ritual Offering (psi hybrids): Whenever you use an abilitech against a target with one or more conditions you inflicted, or conditions that expired on your turn, you can roll and treat it as if it were a psionic attack, and gain advantage for each such condition.

It moves and acts as you will it, without an action cost, able to make a ranged (30 ft.) psionic attack (your psi attack bonuses) against a target's AC, dealing Pd4+PCM damage on a hit, with a control range of 50 ft. You can Help this minion regardless of its distance, and Helping it also grants +5 dice sizes to damage. Whenever this minion benefits from Aim dice, Block dice, or damage bonuses from you, it can either heal for 10 hit points or deal an additional 10 damage.
