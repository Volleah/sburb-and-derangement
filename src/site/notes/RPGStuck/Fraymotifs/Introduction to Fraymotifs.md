### Introduction
>[!quote] “How many fraymotif versions must you make, Merc?”

Fraymotifs! We know what they are, rarely used and powerful music-themed abilities. What you as an SM need is something to use.

In general, these should be given out after the player has received a full set of T1 alchemy at the earliest. Make no mistake, these fraymotifs are incredibly potent.

But let's take things one step at a time. What **IS** a fraymotif? RPGStuck uses a different definition from canon, insofar that fraymotifs were never explained at great length.

Paradox Space remembers the sum total of its occurrences across every session, alpha or doomed or otherwise. A fraymotif is a powerful memory of some specific incident considered heroic, insane, or otherwise noteworthy enough to leave a mark in Paradox Space's memory. From there, it ends up sold by consort shops, where players can draw on the memory in the same way they might draw on their aspect, replicating that memory. Typically to lay waste to their enemies.

>[!info] Every fraymotif costs 1 AP to use, and can be used as a free action on your turn (or a reaction outside it) unless otherwise specified, such as Attack fraymotifs. However, every fraymotif can only be used once per long rest, and only one fraymotif can be used per strife.

Furthermore, fraymotifs use their own tier as a numerical bonus for any rolls, checks, etc involved. They scale from tier 1 to tier 5, similar to alchemy. The specific stats will be described in each fraymotif category's section.

### Fraymotif Type Overview

- Attack fraymotifs are one-off fire and forget attacks, capable of doing massive, auto-hit damage.
- Support fraymotifs are team-oriented moves, geared towards giving everyone a significant bonus for the rest of the strife.
- Utility fraymotifs are a catch-all term for hi-powered solo buffs.
- Chain fraymotifs shackle an enemy with a significant impairment or three. It can be destroyed by your enemies, if they can even hit it.
- Totem fraymotifs summon an eponymous object, altering the battlefield for as long as it persists.
- Effigy fraymotifs confer great bonuses to you and/or great maluses to the enemy, as long as the effigy on yourself remains intact.
- Summon fraymotifs call in a friend or three to help out, turning any strife on its head.
