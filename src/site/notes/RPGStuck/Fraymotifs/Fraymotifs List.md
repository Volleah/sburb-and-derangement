## Attack Fraymotifs

> [!quote] "Once, there was a quote here."

> [!tldr] Attack fraymotifs, unlike all the others, are used as major actions. They also use 5+T to hit, but also roll to hit at advantage, though as of this current writing (2023-01-02), more fraymotifs automatically hit than roll, so.

> [!example] Transdimensional Thunderbolt
> The player picks a target within the strife; they take 2Td8+16T true damage, no questions asked; do you see that goober? Do you not want to?

> [!example] Novikov's Gravity Nova
> The player attacks all targets of choice within a 50 ft. sphere centered on any target within the strife. This deals 2Td10+20T damage, half damage on miss.

> [!example] Corrupted Blood
> The player picks a target within the strife; the target takes Td4+4T damage, then gains DoT (damage dealt, 1 minute). If the target dies or if the condition is removed, repeat the attack on the nearest enemy as the DoT jumps to them for the remaining duration. If there is no other enemy, it jumps back onto them instead.

> [!example] Liam's Hammershot Redux
> The player attacks a target of choice within the strife. This deals Td12+12T damage and Dazes, Impairs, and Sticks the target for 2 rounds. If it misses, it still inflicts all conditions but for 4 rounds. The player may choose to automatically miss. Not specific to tealbloods only.

> [!example] Spanish Inquisition
> The player inflicts Lethal (Td10+10T) on all enemies in the strife, including all enemies who join it after casting. Whenever a creature with Lethal takes damage, the magnitude of Lethal on all enemies increases by +T, up to a maximum of 50T. Unfortunately, people expect it.

> [!example] Anguish and Agony
> The player picks a target within the strife; they take 2Td6+12T damage. When this target dies, all other enemies take this damage as well, while the player heals for half the damage dealt.
## Support Fraymotifs

## Chain Fraymotifs

>[!quote] "Once, there was a quote here."

>[!tldr] Chain fraymotifs place a Chain on the targeted enemy that counts as a called shot with a +4 modifier on said enemy. The enemy itself may target the chain as well, but has disadvantage for it. The chain lasts for 1 minute or until the end of the strife, unless otherwise specified.

>[!tldr] The chain has AC/resistances of 10+2T, with 10 HP at T1, 15 HP at T2, 25 HP at T3, 45 HP at T4, and 75 HP at T5.

>[!example] Vitalist's Last Laugh 
>You chain the target with a radionic wave generator. When the chained performs any major or minor action, the summoner and all allies of choice heal for 2T hit points.

>[!example] Damocles' Guillotine 
>You chain the target with an overhead guillotine that doesn't actually do anything until activated as a free action. When used, it can deal Td6+6T damage per condition present on the chained. Alternately, it can be loosed as part of a damaging attack to deal an additional +100% damage.

>[!example] Heartbreak Hostage 
>You chain the target with red strings. The summoner assumes direct control of the chained. The target cannot be compelled to take suicidal or impossible actions. However, the chain's called shot becomes a +2 modifier.

>[!example] Ostracize 
>You chain the target with a dunce's cap that looks especially stupid. At the start of each of the chained's turns, all other allies of the chained (so the summoner's enemies in most cases) have DoT (4T). If the chained is within 50 feet of them when the DoT is applied, double the damage. They also feel extra bad if you make fun of them.

>[!example] Separation Anxiety 
>You chain the target with a comically oversized magnet. The chained has DoT (4T). If the chained is not adjacent to any other creatures in the strife when the DoT is applied, double the damage.

>[!example] Gallery of Souls 
>You chain the target with a spectral shackle as a ghostly jury watches the proceedings. All damage against the chained have +50% bonus damage, but if there are any other enemies within the strife, all damage taken by the chained must be distributed among all other enemies within the strife.

>[!example] Unholy Isolation 
>You chain the target with… actual chains, steel spiked links. They generate a 30 ft. radius zone around the chained. All creatures of choice inside the zone have Impair and DoT (3T), and all creatures of choice outside have +4 AC and Regen (3T).

## Totem Fraymotifs

> [!quote] "Once, there was a quote here."

> [!tldr] Totem fraymotifs place a Medium-sized object that appears within 100 feet of the player. The totem lasts for 1 minute or until the end of the strife, unless otherwise specified.

> [!tldr] The totem has AC/resistances of 10+2T, with 20 HP at T1, 30 HP at T2, 50 HP at T3, 90 HP at T4, and 150 HP at T5.

> [!example] Stasis Field
> You summon a stasis generator. All creatures of choice within a 100 ft. radius have their base speed halved, have any bonus movement halved, cannot Dash, and take -6 to their AC/Reflex.

> [!example] Jade Salient

> [!example] Cannibal's Fortune Messiah
> You summon a shrine to the random number god. Up to twice per round, when a d20 is rolled, the summoner may switch that d20 roll with a recorded roll. Instead of switching a roll, the summoner may choose to reroll the dice as one of their 2/round uses.

> [!example] More Gun
> You summon a gun. No it's just a literal gun. For every two attacks the summoner lands on the same turn, the totem replicates the attack roll, making an attack at all targets in the strife for Td4+4T damage. It's a very fast gun.

> [!example] Holy Sanctuary
> You summon an angel statue, possibly Biblically accurate. It generates a 30 ft. radius zone around it. All creatures of choice inside the zone have either Regen (3T) or DoT (3T), and all attacks of choice made outside it are Impaired.

> [!example] Vanade's Mirror Trick
> You uniquely summon four silvered mirrors instead of just one. Whenever you use an area of effect attack or multiple-target attack, each of the mirrors pulse for half the damage dealt, as the center of the AoE (AoEs) or using the attack's range (multi-target). Each mirror may move up to the summoner's base speed on their summoner's turn.

## Effigy Fraymotifs

> [!quote] "Once, there was a quote here."

> [!tldr] Effigy fraymotifs place an effigy on the player that counts as a called shot with a +4 modifier on them. As a reminder, called shots against the effigy won't damage the player themselves, except for any leftover damage from an attack that destroys it. The effigy lasts for 1 minute or until the end of the strife, unless otherwise specified.

> [!tldr] The effigy has 10 HP at T1, 15 HP at T2, 25 HP at T3, 45 HP at T4, and 75 HP at T5.

> [!example] Sinclair's Saving Grace
> You summon the eponymous musician's dance shoes. The summoner can fly, can turn/unturn intangible as a free action once per round, gain advantage on all attack rolls and skill checks, force disadvantage on all attack rolls and skill checks made against them, ignore all Block dice, ignore all disadvantage, and ignore all conditions expect Incapacitation. They also make you feel fancy.

> [!example] Pyrocaustic Flow
> You summon Dave Strider's mixtape on vinyl. Once per turn the summoner can make an attack as a free action, targeting a 30 ft. sphere centered within a 100 ft. range as a ranged attack with 5+T to hit, dealing Td4+4T damage to everyone in it. The spheres persist after hitting; any enemies (but not summoner or allies) that starts their turn in or enter the flames take 4T damage and cannot heal, gain temp HP, or benefit from Aim or Block dice.

> [!example] Steelrot Cumulus
> You summon a set of osseous wind chimes, possibly made of other players. The effigy forces Fade (4), Setback (4), Sunder (4), and +4 to crit range on attacks against, on all creatures of choice.

> [!example] Void King's Curtain
> You summon a luxuriant set of velvet curtains colored navy blue like Void. The summoner auto-passes all Distract checks. The curtain also has a DC of 15+2T; all enemies are Blinded and auto-hit attacks must roll to hit until they pass a Discern check on the player against this DC. But this Discern check is also made at disadvantage.

> [!example] Punishment Sphere
> You summon a VR headset of terrible implication. The effigy forces Setback (5) on all creatures of choice. Whenever said creature makes an attack, they take 3T damage, double if they miss. However, if said creature spends its turn without attempting an attack roll or skill check, it takes 4T damage anyway.

> [!example] Inclement Weather
> You summon a heavy-duty, leather-bound farmer's almanac chained to yourself with which to predict lightning exactly where your enemies are. Once per turn the summoner can make an attack, targeting anyone within the strife with a ranged attack with 5+T to hit, dealing Td10+5T damage.

> [!example] Call Giant Crab Lusus

It also has advantage to grappling rolls, uses 6+2T for its grapple checks, and has +50% more HP. it also has a minor action but it can only Crush a target it is grappling with this minor, dealing Td4+4T damage. It does not have a weak spot for massive damage.

> [!example] Call Normal Cat
> You summon a Small perfectly ordinary cat. It can attack as a major, a 5 ft. melee attack for Td8+8T damage. It also has a minor action but it can only Distract with this minor, and uses 6+2T for its Distract checks.

While alive, all enemies have Setback (2) and at the start of each of its turns, all enemies take 2T damage. However, it has base 10 ft. speed.

> [!example] Call Tesseract Prism
> You summon a Medium crystal thing with either many or no legs. It can attack as a major, a 50 ft. ranged attack that hits all enemies for Td4+4T damage, or can select itself or an ally and give half damage as stackable temp HP. While alive, whenever its summoner or their allies take any damage, half of the damage is redirected to the crystal; the damage taken is then also taken by the attacker.

> [!example] Call Clown Car
> You summon a Large swarm of clowns. They can attack as a major, a 10 ft. melee attack for Td3+3T damage. It has an additional +20 to hit, and when attacking, for every 5 over the AC/resist that the attack roll is, it deals its damage an additional time. It also has 40 ft. base speed and can fly. How did this make it into the final draft?
