## Overview of Followers

>[!quote] “You became friends with Yosuke! Yosuke will now DIE FOR YOU.”

As you’ve probably noticed, you’re not alone in your session. There are consorts on your own Land, and carapacians on the moons and Veil. Some of the more skilled inhabitants of the Medium may be persuaded to come join you, whether it be out of mutual interest, a fee paid in currency, favors, or something else, an unwilling necessity, just plain boredom and/or benevolence, or some other thing as the plot dictates.

Followers have multiple tiers just like alchemy, monsters, etc. The higher a follower’s tier, the more proficient they are in their field of expertise, with higher skill bonuses and increased combat ability. Their proficiencies as listed for the specific follower should not be taken as the only things a follower can do. They are capable of as broad a range of tasks as any other creature, and are simply specialized in their listed bonuses.

We recommend that SMs stick to one follower accompanying the player at a time, maybe two in times of great need such as an upcoming Adversary or some great challenge requiring multiple sets of expertise.

## List of Followers

There are sixteen types of followers provided for your consideration, fifteen of them focused in some combination of two stats. Their base stat blocks can be found by bringing up the follower stat blocks in the SM session sheet. Each type of follower then makes the following modifications to it:

- Pick the same tier as the tier of monsters a player would fight at their level.
- One stakes die when making skill checks with their focused stats.
- +4 bonus to their focused stats.
- A basic attack.
- A passive bonus that benefits the player in a strife.
- A rapid action to be used at the player's behest.
- A specialization chosen separately from the follower type.

The sixteenth is a generalized follower to represent more well-rounded or generic sorts, such as a sprite for which reskinning some other archetype doesn't quite work out.

- Still pick the same tier as the player, or leave them at T0 or T1 if the player is intended to outgrow them.
- +2 to all skill checks, though no stakes dice or specializations.
- A basic attack, passive bonus, and rapid action like the others.

A table of their stats has been posted below for ease of reference.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Follower Tier|HP|AC/Resist|DC|Base Stats|Hit Bonus|Base Damage|Mod|
|0|12|13|10|0|5|2|1|
|1|26|14|15|1|6|4|2|
|2|70|14|15|2|7|14|6|
|3|140|15|20|3|8|26|11|
|4|219|15|20|4|9|44|18|
|5|350|16|20|5|10|70|28|

There are multiple ways to actually integrate a follower into a strife. The SM can have the follower actively participate in the strife with their own turn in initiative order, counting them as a co-player for the purposes of calculating CR; they can stick to their basic attack, or also use the common actions as listed in the Primer, as the SM desires.

The simplest option would be to have the follower handle their own strife or find some other reason to be occupied, only lending a hand when the player calls for their rapid action to be used. This would functionally reduce the follower to their passive bonus and once per strife ability, which limits their potential and complexity, but makes it very simple for an SM to run.

Conversely, for SMs seeking increased complexity, they should feel free to mix and match archetypes. Additionally, some archetypes have specibi or powers listed; giving them additional abilities along those lines, allowing players to alchemize things for them, giving them Steps, and the like can make everything get very complex very quickly. However, there is a certain demographic within RPGStuck that relishes such things, so.
