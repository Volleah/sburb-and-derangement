Sometimes the player may want a one-off service, not a persistent follower. And sometimes (usually), the players want to use their boondollars for other things. They want to go food shopping, buy tickets for the fair, bribe the police to look the other way, grease the palms of a special interest group opposed to the queen, hire a stalker to hunt down and kidnap someone. Ordinary and non-frightening things you can type in a Google search.

>[!info] Hirelings represent a wide variety of services your players see fit to hire at some point. They can be split into unskilled, skilled, and special categories.
>- **Unskilled** represents day laborers, servants, maids, and other menial labor. Unskilled hirelings/services go for 75 to 300 normally.
>	- A maximum of 2000 for extraordinary circumstances.
>- **Skilled** represents masons, scribes, carpenters, painters, and such trades that need apprenticeship or previous education of some kind. Skilled hirelings/services go from 150 to 600 normally.
>	- A maximum of 4500 for extraordinary circumstances.
>- **Special** represents doctors, lawyers, and other trades that need several years to a lifetime of experience fall under this. Special hirelings/services go from 300 to 1200 normally.
>	- A maximum of 9000 for extraordinary circumstances.

>[!info] Mundane items, in the context of RPGStuck, represent anything that could’ve been made with build grist alone. They cost anywhere from 1 to 1000 boondollars.
>This is something the player can just make themselves.
>But perhaps it's too much of a hassle, or perhaps they’re on the moon and don’t have access to their alchemiter.
> Use a conversion ratio of 10 boondollars per build grist for things that would require an inordinate amount of build grist.

>[!info] Exceptional items, for items that would require tiered grist to create were it made at an alchemiter. Tiered items are typically not sold or stocked to begin with until a player is of the appropriate level for said tier. Tiered items roughly go for 800 BD for T1, 2400 for T2, 12000 for T3, 21000 for T4, 42000 for T5, with the caveat that a player can only buy as high a tier as they currently are.
