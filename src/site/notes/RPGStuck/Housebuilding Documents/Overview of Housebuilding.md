As you build up your house towards the Seven Gates, you will find that the empty space in your ever-expanding house could stand to be filled in. 
Every time you reach a new gate, you gain one **Room Point (RP)**. 
RP is an abstraction to represent this extra space, and you can refurbish it towards a variety of ends. You have utility and skill buildings towards this end.

Furthermore, you are not alone in the Incipisphere. You inhabit the same world as civilizations of amphibians and carapacians, spread out across planets, meteors, and moons, living under kingdoms and who knows what else. Some of these people might become your followers, accompanying you on your Land quest and beyond.

There are also guidelines for how to spend the Boondollars you gain at every level, but given the diverse nature of Sburb and the myriad tones of each session, BD costs are given as ranges for the SM to decide as fits their session.
