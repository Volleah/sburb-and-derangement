## Building Costs
>[!quote] “When you get right down to it, what we all need is a place to go. A place where we can escape the noise of our lives and just relax.”

>[!tip] The Build Grist cost for a player to raise their house to the next gate, as well as the cost of additional buildings, is dependent on session speed.

>[!tldr] Raising the house to the next gate costs 25 Build Grist. You can build it up seven times, once for each gate, and gain 1 RP each time you do so. As your RP increases, so does the number of buildings you can have in your house.

>[!tldr] Building a utility building costs 10 Build Grist. They require no RP to build.

>[!tldr] Building a skill building or upgrading it costs 25 Build Grist. You can have as many skill buildings as you have RP (max 7), but you must have the base building before buying any upgrades.

>[!tip] Remember that per canon, your server player has to build these things for you. However, canon did not have scheduling issues, so the Autobuilder utility building can be built by the player themselves, and said Autobuilder allows the player to build everything else by themselves.

## Buil**dings**
### Utility Buildings

>[!tldr] A variety of upgrades to your house meant to act as quality of life improvements. None of these buildings require any RP. Additionally, since they are not tiered, they can be built in any desired order.

##### Automatic Builder

>[!info] Allows Client players to build as if they were the Server player if the server player is unavailable.
>*Uniquely, this may be built by the Client player without requiring the Server player.*

##### Frog Breeding Central

>[!info] As seen in canon. It lets you take frogs and breed them for creating the Genesis Frog.

>[!info] You can see what item will come of an alchemy and its cost before you make it.

### Skill Buildings

>[!tldr] These buildings serve a variety of functions for the player to better leverage and make use of their skills. These come in base versions and upgrades to those base versions. Each base building takes 1 RP, as does each upgrade to a base building, and only one given building or upgrade may be built.

##### Danger Room

>[!info] The hologram generator awaits, categories and lists of simulations ready to play on command. The walls are reinforced steel dyed green, to reflect whatever chosen environment the danger room participant desires.
