In many tabletop games, this would be around the time when you select a class for your character *(no no, not like Heir or Prince, more like Fighter or.. ...Bard. Shoosh)*. In RPGStuck, however, we have created something more flexible, called [[RPGStuck/Pillars and Paths/Pillars and Paths\|Pillars and Paths]] (PnP).

As a first level character, you are entitled to select your Pillar and unlock your first Milestone. Pick the Pillar below that most appeals to you (and hopefully complements the choices you have made so far!) and make note of it on the Character tab of your sheet, under the Pillars and Paths section. If a Pillar has more than one Milestone listed, you may select whichever one you like.

In PnP, every character belongs to one of three Pillars, and may select abilities (called Steps) from Paths once every other level. You are welcome to pick whatever Steps you like, but if you collect abilities from Paths that belong to your Pillar, you can unlock unique Milestones.


>[!important] Note: Keystones
>Some Paths have the keystone tag to them. Keystones are Paths that have some innate potency to them; as a result, once you have a Step from a keystone Path, you cannot take Steps from any other keystone Paths. These Paths will have an entry at the top, separate from the other Steps. This part is innate to the keystone, and is unlocked when any Step is taken from it.
