### Sentinel

>[!quote] "As I breathe, you will not pass the castle gate!"

#### Path of the Battlemind (keystone)

>[!quote] “My mind is my shield!”

Mental Fortress: When you take any Step in Path of the Battlemind, you gain a psionic Barrier. Any damage you take is taken by the Barrier before anything else, such as temporary hit points, but Aegis and similar effects still apply to damage taken this way. The Barrier has a hit point maximum of (2*Lvl)+PCM, and regenerates P hit points whenever you expend a lesser slot, and 2P hit points whenever you finish a short rest, long rest, or expend a greater slot.

- Mind Shield: Once per round, when you gain any negative condition of duration 2 minutes or less, make an Endurance or psi skill check. If this check beats the attacker's DC, the condition(s) is denied. Additionally, you regen +P additional Barrier when finishing a short rest, long rest, or expending a greater slot.
- Disruption: As a reaction, you can apply one d4 Block die against an attack targeting AC/resistances. Additionally, your block radius is increased by 25 feet.
- Mind Spike: Whenever your Barrier takes damage, the attacker takes psionic damage equal to half the damage taken by it. Additionally, you regen +PCM additional Barrier for expending lesser slots and your maximum Barrier is increased by your Level.
- Mental Shackles: Targets of choice within your block radius have Setback (1, stackable). Expending psionic slots during a strife increases this by 1, up to Setback (3, stackable) for the duration of the strife. Using a greater slot immediately raises it to its maximum.
- Collective Wall: As a free action, you can extend your Barrier to allies within 100 feet. Additionally, your Barrier counts as temporary hit points, and half of excess Barrier gained is converted to a bonus on your next instance of damage dealt (up to 2P).

#### Path of the Bulwark

>[!quote] “Their defense crumbles quickly.”

- Phalanx Formations: If there are any allies or objectives adjacent to you or within your block radius, once per round you can either Aim or Avert as a free action with +1 die size.
- Unstoppable: Once per strife, as a reaction, you gain +5 to AC/resistances for 1 round.
- Guarded Strike: Whenever you generate Block dice or reduce an enemy's damage dealt, you gain CON temporary hit points. At the start of each turn, if you have any temp HP from this, it disappears and you add the lost temp HP to your next damage roll.
- The Wall: You reduce any forced movement taken by 10 feet, and you have advantage on Block dice if you grant them for an ally or the Blocked attack would target an ally.
- Harassing Advance: Any difficult terrain that you create requires an additional foot of speed spent per foot moved. In most cases, difficult terrain now requires 3 feet of speed for every 1 foot moved, up from 2 feet per 1 foot.

#### Path of the Champion

>[!quote] “A mighty warrior must have a mighty roar!”

Custodian Stance: Certain Steps in this Path let you learn the Custodian Stance. Those Steps also imbue the stance with abilities; these abilities are cumulative.

- Battlecry: As a minor action, make a Charisma attack roll against a target, targeting Will. If you break resistance, you impose one d3 Aim die and one d3 Block die on the target for 1 round, or pick one if you do not. You may roll at disadvantage to either do this for all targets of choice in the strife or gain +2 die sizes.

- I Am Your Enemy: You learn the Custodian Stance. While in this stance, attack rolls and skill checks targeting or originating within your block radius have disadvantage if they do not target you. Additionally, your block radius is increased by 10 feet.
- To the Death: As a major action (or as part of a non-damaging major action), you may taunt an enemy by making a Charisma attack roll against them, targeting Will. If you break resistance, they are sent into a reckless flurry; they gain advantage to all attacks against you, but disadvantage to all skill checks, and all attacks and skill checks against them also gain advantage. This effect lasts for 5 rounds, and targets may choose to be hit by this.
- Bodyguard: You learn the Custodian Stance. While in this stance, as a reaction, you may redirect an attack made within your block radius to yourself. If you use a reaction for an ally (such as Blocking for them), you may do this as part of the reaction instead. Additionally, your block radius is increased by 10 feet.
- Ominous Presence: Allies may add your Charisma mod to damage rolls against targets adjacent to you, or within your block radius. Enemies within your block radius take -50% bonus damage when they benefit from Assail.

#### Path of the Dreadnought

>[!quote] "I am the only army I need.”

- Decimating Strike: Once per turn, when you land an attack, make a second attack (of the same type) as a free action, targeting all creatures within a 30 ft. cone (drawn from yourself or the original target), targeting Fortitude. For each target, if you break resistance, you deal P damage. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Bastion: At the start of each turn, you may have Ward (P) against all physical damage or against all psionic damage. If you have at least a +8 to Athletics, Endurance, or Sanity, it becomes purely Ward (P).

- Din of the Dying: Once per strife, as a free action, reduce your HP and max HP by Con+P, then gain Con+P temp HP (5 rounds). When this temp HP expires, make a finesse melee attack against all targets within 10 ft. range, targeting Fortitude. For each target, if you break resistance, deal Pd6 damage. This is a basic abilitech and at-will subpower.

- Goliath's Glory: As a free action, reduce your HP and max HP by 2P hit points, then remove all conditions of choice from yourself. You are immune to all conditions of choice (except any gained from falling to 0 HP) and ignore disadvantage and difficult terrain for 1 minute.

- Spiteful Reprisal: As a reaction to an attacker inflicting a condition on or critically hitting you, make an attack roll (using any stat), targeting their Fortitude. If you break resistance, the target is either Exposed (1 round) or Impaired (1 round).

#### Path of the Hydra (keystone)

>[!quote] "Who stopped the Beast from telling its own story? And why?"

Hail Hydra: When you take any Step in Path of the Hydra, you gain the Opportunist milestone; if you already have it, it instead hits for Pd2 damage and benefits from die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers. Either way, your block radius is increased by another 5 feet.

- Alcaean Invocation: When landing a damaging attack, you may take -50% damage to inflict the Enervated condition on the target for 1 minute. An Enervated creature has DoT (P) per Cripple (10), up to DoT (3P) at Crippled (30) or Stuck, and extends the duration of any Cripples on it by 1 round.
- Dire Setback: Whenever you inflict a negative condition on a target, the target has Setback (1, stackable) for each type of condition for their durations, up to Setback (3, stackable).
- Herakles' Bane: Once per round, when you deal damage with Opportunist, you can take -100% damage to Expose, Impair, or Stick the target for 1 round.
- Lernean Scales: When you Defend as a major action, you grant yourself and all allies within block radius Aegis (P, 1 round), and your next Opportunist reaction before the start of your next turn has +1 die size to damage.

- Coils of the Hydra: When you Defend as a major action, you gain an extra reaction which can only be used to take an action that imposes Block dice (assuming you have one to begin with), and the +1 die size applies to all Opportunist reactions for 1 round. [Requires Lernean Scales]

#### Path of the Immortal

>[!quote] “But it refused.”

- Healing Surge: During a strife, as a free action, you may roll (without spending) a Hit Die, add your Proficiency, then heal for that many hit points. Usable twice per short rest.

- Second Wind: After using Healing Surge, your next damaging major action adds the amount healed to the damage roll. [Requires Healing Surge]

- Stand and Fight: Once per strife, as part of rolling for initiative or a minor action, make an attack roll (using any stat) against a target, targeting Will. If you break resistance, the target gets called the heck out. If they end their turns further than they started for any reason, they are Impaired for the rest of the strife. This effect lasts for 5 rounds or until the Impairment is triggered.
- Fury of the True Hero: Once per short rest, when at half HP (ignoring temp HP) or lower in a strife, as a free action you may enter a heroic fury. You heal for HP equal to twice your Level and gain Regen (P, 5 rounds). While the Regen persists, you count as being at half HP or less and add +1 die size to damage.
- Lamb's Shield: When you have Regen, you also have Aegis (P) for its duration. If you are healed by other means, you have Aegis (P, 1 round).

#### Path of Ivory

>[!quote] “What actually transpires beneath the veil of an event horizon?"

- Vector Pin: Once per round as a free action, pick a target. The target has +2 to AC/resistances for 1 round.
- Memetic Agent: As a major action, make an Intelligence attack roll against a target within 60 feet, targeting Will. If you break resistance, inflict Impaired (3 rounds).
- Field Theory: You are always considered to be in half cover (but are still visible). If you find other cover, you instead have a +2 bonus to its benefits.
- Acceleration Stance: While in the Acceleration Stance, allies within 100 feet of you can add your Intelligence modifier to their damage rolls. If they move by any means besides a move action (including forced movement), you can increase or decrease it by 5 feet.

- Blueshift: While in the Acceleration Stance, you can spend up to half base speed on your turns to move all allies and enemies within range for the speed spent, each one moved as desired. For enemies, you can alternately inflict Cripple (X, 1 round), with the spent speed as magnitude. [Requires Acceleration Stance]

#### Path of the Marauder

>[!quote] “Towering, fierce, terrible. Nightmare made material.”

- Bloodlust: Gain Lvl/2 temporary hit points after you successfully land an attack. This can only happen once per turn.
- Glorious: Once per turn, upon killing an enemy, you gain Pd6 temporary HP. And once per turn, you gain P temp HP after successfully landing an attack on a creature, if the creature is of your current tier (or higher) and CR 3 or higher.
- Gracious: 2P times per long rest, you may add your Constitution modifier twice when rolling a Hit Die, instead of once.
- Guts and Glory: When at half HP (ignoring temp HP) or lower, your damage rolls and Block dice have +1 die size.
- Spoils of War: At the end of a strife, if you have any temporary hit points, you can spend them to heal for the spent temp HP (up to twice your Level).

#### Path of Martial Spirit (keystone)

>[!quote] “They were magnificent. I only hope that when it is my time, I may die with half as much dignity as I saw in their eyes in the end.”

Pankrator: When you take any Step in Path of Martial Spirit, you gain an ability called Avoid. When you generate Block dice, you can hold onto them, granting them as a free action as desired, though Block dice held this way only last 1 round. When you use or grant held Block dice, as a reaction you make it impose disadvantage on the Blocked attack instead of rolling the Block die(s). If the die(s) would last for a duration instead of single use, the disadvantage applies to all attacks for 1 round instead.

- Spirit of Mars: You have +1 to AC/resistances. If you have at least a +8 to Endurance or Sanity, this increases to +2 and also grants +2 to hit.
- Improved Defense: When you Defend as a major action in a strife, all attacks of choice targeting or originating within your block radius for 1 round are Weakened. Your next damaging abilitech is then Empowered.
- Mountain's Resilience: You have a special DC equal to 10+P+Endurance. When an ability imposes a negative condition(s) of duration 2 minutes or less on you, if the ability required an attack roll or skill check, check it. If it does not beat this DC, you ignore those condition(s). Additionally, you can rest for 1 minute to remove any negative conditions/effects that need a short rest or less.
- Warden's Presence: Your block radius is increased by 10 feet, and you and your allies can add your Constitution modifier to damage done.
- Lord of War: When you Avoid, you can reuse the die as an Aim die, instead Assail for Avoid's beneficiary or yourself (or on the target if those dice are on the target), or grant the Avoid's beneficiary advantage to their next Distract roll and +1 to any bonuses they gain from it.

#### Path of the Nemesis

>[!quote] "You stand before the High King. I will hear you beg now."

- Heads Will Roll: When at half HP (ignoring temp HP) or lower, you have an extra reaction per round.
- Animate Animus: You have +1 die size to damage rolls made as a reaction.
- Book of Grudges: In a strife, when you take damage from an attacker, you gain one Grudge. If you would gain a Grudge when at three Grudges, you go to zero Grudges and add Pd3+mod (of choice) to your next damage roll. This effect cannot be stacked, any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Temper Tantrum: Once per strife, when you miss a damaging attack roll or lose an opposing skill check, you lash out as a reaction, using a damaging basic abilitech or at-will subpower that has -50% damage but automatically hits.
- You Dare?!: In a strife, when you have flat bonuses to AC and/or resistances (such as cover, Ward, Spirit of Mars) and still get hit by a damaging attack roll, you can add half the total relevant bonus to your next attack roll or skill check against the attacker.

#### Path of the Shieldbearer

>[!quote] “The best lightning rod for your protection is your own spine.”

- Bonus Block: Every round, you gain an extra reaction which can only be used to take an action that imposes Block dice (assuming you have one to begin with). If you have a specibus that can impose Block dice but do not know the abilitech, you learn it, ignoring the die size penalty for being a psion if applicable.
- Bonus Slam: If you use an abilitech as a one-handed major action with a specibus that can impose Block dice, you may follow it up with a damaging basic abilitech or at-will subpower in the other hand as a minor action at -1 die size. This counts as a combo attack.
- Defensive Stance: While in the Defensive Stance, your movement speed is reduced to 10 feet, but gain +1 Block die size, +1 to AC/resistances, reduce all forced movement taken by 10 feet, and add +P to any temp HP gained. You must be able to generate Block dice as a reaction to benefit from this stance.
- Improved Push: When you use an abilitech that inflicts forced movement, you can either increase the distance moved by 10 feet, or exchange any forced movement for knocking the target Prone instead.
- Concussive Throw: As a minor action after making a ranged attack from a melee specibus, inflict Daze and Cripple (10) for 1 round.

#### Path of the Tantras

>[!quote] “A road which has no destination is itself a destination.”

- Chi Disruption: Once per round, when you land a single-target damaging attack, you may take -50% damage to inflict Weaken (1 round). If you have at least a +8 to Perception, you either also inflict Expose (1 round) or remove the single target requirement.
- Clear the Loom: Whenever you gain a negative condition of duration 2 minutes or less, or take forced movement, you may spend P hit points as a free action to ignore it.
- Worship Iron: As a minor action, you gain +1 to AC/resistances and Aegis (P, 1 round). If you have at least a +8 to Insight, you may Avert as part of the minor action (and now counts as Averting for any synergies).
- Crown Doctrine: When you make attack rolls or skill checks against a single target, your allies may add your Wisdom modifier to their damage rolls against that target for 1 round. If they already add your Wis mod by any means, they can choose to take +1 die size instead.
- Paradoxical Embrace: Once per turn, when you use a non-damaging major and/or minor action abilitech or subpower in a strife, you may also inflict one of the following on a target within 60 feet: Faded (2), Sundered (2), Doom (P). These conditions stack with themselves from other sources.


### Slayer

>[!quote] “Aren’t you tired of being nice?”

#### Path of the Adherent

>[!quote] “We are all insects. Groping towards something terrible or divine.”

- Motes of Power: In a strife, on each of your turns, the first time you land a damaging abilitech, and the first time you land a damaging subpower, you gain one Mote each, up to two Motes a turn. If you would gain a Mote when at three Motes, you add Pd3+PCM to the damage roll that triggered this, then go to zero Motes. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Unfettered Channeling: When casting a damaging psionic power, you may give it +1 die size, but a roll of 4 or less on the d20 causes you to explode, dealing Pd4+PCM damage to all creatures within 10 feet of you, and half that damage to yourself.
- Surge of Strength: If you would make a damaging combo attack with advantage as a major action, you can also make combo attacks with reactions that turn at -50% damage.
- Psionic Renewal: Whenever you cast a psionic subpower on yourself that confers some benefit that lasts 2 minutes or less, you have +1 to hit while this benefit is active. You can have up to +3 to hit in this way.
- Catalytic Brand: When landing a single-target damaging abilitech, you may take -50% damage and spend a lesser slot as a minor action to inflict the Catalyzed (1 minute) condition on the target. When a lesser slot is used within 100 feet of a Catalyzed creature (including the slot spent on it), it also imposes Sunder (2, stacks to 6). This is a subpower.

#### Path of Allegro

>[!quote] "Perfection is not good enough.”

- Agitato: When you land a damaging ranged attack, you gain a stack of Agitation, gaining +P damage to one ranged damage roll per stack per turn. You may do this once per turn but also once per others' turns. If you already have 3 stacks when gaining more, you instead reset to no stacks. This effect only persists while in a strife.

- Amoroso: When you land a ranged attack that resets your stacks of Agitation, you deal an additional Pd6 damage. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this. [Requires Agitato]

- Amabile & Affettuoso: When you land ranged attacks against Dazed, Exposed, or Incapacitated enemies, or during a surprise round, your attacks inflict Rupture (P, 3 rounds). Once per round, single-target attacks against Ruptured targets let you move 10 feet as part of the action.
- Acceso: Once per turn, when you land a ranged attack against a target, you can either count the Ruptured condition as double its magnitude or extend its duration by 1 round.
- Armonioso & Anima: Once per short rest, as a full-round action, all unseen enemies within a cone equal to your weapon’s maximum range or psionic power’s range is revealed to you. As part of this action, you may then make a ranged attack against an enemy within this cone. If the damage roll has a damage modifier added, add the damage modifier again. Additionally, the attack gains +30 ft. range, and weapons do not have disadvantage for rolling to hit beyond normal range.

#### Path of the Anarcanist

>[!quote] “I will show you true power, stop laughing!"

- Gathering Storm: Whenever you expend a lesser slot, you gain +P to all psionic damage (including any damage from expending the slot). This effect stacks twice, to +2P, and resets after a minute without casting a slotted power. If you expend a greater slot, immediately get the +2P bonus (includes any damage from the greater slot).
- Collective Psi Theory: You gain +1 to hit with a psionic attack per each of the following you would be able to add to its damage roll if it hits (to a maximum of +3): Proficiency, a stat mod other than your PCM, Level, Pd(X) dice, Doom, Rupture.
- Resonant Hex: Whenever you deal damage with a psionic attack, you also inflict DoT (P psionic damage, 5 rounds).
- Arcanoclasm: When you deal damage with a slotted subpower, you may burn it out, adding any flat damage bonuses (stat mods, P, Doom, etc) or any Pd(X) dice an additional time, but rendering those damage bonuses and the subpower unusable for 2 rounds.
- Crown of Desperation: When at half HP (ignoring temp HP) or lower, your psionic attack rolls have +2 crit range.

#### Path of the Artillery

>[!quote] “Ultima ratio regum.”

- Prone Position: You no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls against Prone targets. As long as you are Prone, all ranged damage rolls have +1 die size.
- Enhance!: As a minor action, you either take advantage on your next Perception check, or gain +4 on your next ranged attack roll. You may use this Lvl times per short rest.
- Steady Aim: If you have not taken a move action for two turns (12 seconds), you gain advantage on ranged damage rolls until you next move.
- One in the Hand: While you are prone and have not movedved for two turns (12 seconds), you are able to swiftly reload one round into your weapon after you fire it. This reload is considered part of the attack, must meet any other requirements to reload (such as any cache costs), and may be done once per round until the next time you move.
- One Shot, One Kill: If you have not taken a move action for two turns (12 seconds), Empowered grants you an additional +1 die size. If the Empowered damage roll benefits from Doom, you may add Doom's magnitude an additional time.

#### Path of the Desperado

>[!quote] “You see, in this world there are two kinds of people, my friend…"

- Wandering Deliverance: Your attacks against Doomed targets have one d3 Aim die (or +1 die size to an existing Aim die). As a major action, you can say something pithy, inflict Doom (P) on a target, and give your next attack roll or skill check advantage.
- Homestead Act: At the end of each of your turns, if any enemies are within a range equal to your base speed, you have +1 to AC/resistances for 1 round. If you have at least a +8 to Endurance or Intimidation, this is raised to +2 instead.
- Bucking Buckaroo: When you land a damaging attack that inflicts Cripple, you can remake the attack roll against the target's Fortitude. If you break resistance, you trade Cripple for Prone.
- Active Reload: Choose one:

- Lead the Target: If you Reload as a minor action, you can Aim or Avert as part of the action.
- Multitasker: If you Reload as a major action, you can Defend, Help, Grapple (or escape one), or Shove as part of the action.

- Aces and Eights: Once per strife, as part of rolling for initiative or as a free action, make an initiative roll against a target's Reflex. If you break resistance, your next damaging attack roll against them has advantage and deals an additional Pd3 damage. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.

#### Path of the Einhander

>[!quote] “Since it is so likely that children will meet cruel enemies, let them have at least heard of brave knights and heroic courage.”

Einhander Style: To benefit from the special actions and bonuses in this path, you must be wielding a one-handed weapon in one hand, and have the other hand free (a psionic focus and grappling with the free hand is exempt from this restriction).

- Versetzen: You can move through other creatures' space, but you must end your movements outside it. If you move by any means besides a move action (including forced movement), you can increase or decrease it by up to 10 feet; you can move 10 feet as a minor action but this does not benefit from that bonus.

- Follow Up!: At the end of a short rest, pick a damaging at-will subpower or basic abilitech that you know. When you move by means besides a move action (but not forced movement), you can use it as part of the action to move, but it rolls at disadvantage and deals half damage. [Requires Versetzen]

- Fatal Clash: P times per short rest, as a reaction to using or being targeted by a melee attack, you and the target (or attacker) make opposed melee attack rolls. If you beat the opposing attack roll, you deal Pd3 damage and knock the target Prone.
- Swift Hews: You can Shove with the empty hand as a minor action. Additionally, when you Shove, you can choose to move yourself instead of the target; you gain advantage on the check when using it in this way and you gain +1 crit range on your next attack roll per 15 feet you move in that way, up to +4.
- Duelist's Stance: You may enter the Duelist's Stance only by resting for 1 minute outside of a strife. While you are in this stance, you can impose one d3 Block die as a reaction against attacks targeting your AC or Reflex. As a free action, you may exit the Duelist's Stance to take an Aim die's maximum instead of rolling.

#### Path of Gun-Fu

>[!quote] “When the sun is out, thou better taketh thine guns out.”

- Gun Fury Stance: While in the Gun Fury Stance, if you add your Strength or Dexterity mod to damage rolls on ranged abilitechs made against targets within a range equal to half your speed, you may add the other stat’s mod and your Proficiency as well. Additionally, you ignore penalties for using ranged abilitechs against adjacent targets.

- Hong Kong Action Theater: While in the Gun Fury Stance, you may add your Dexterity to initiative rolls an additional time, and may move half your base speed as part of rolling for initiative and as a reaction, but not if Stuck. [Requires Gun Fury Stance]

- Double Tap: Once per turn, when you land an abilitech against a target while wielding a Reload specibus, you may expend a basic abilitech's worth of rounds/charges (min 1) to Assail for the combined total of STR, DEX, and P.
- Gunmetal Gymnast: Once per short rest, as a free action, gain +1 to your hit bonus, AC, and Reflex, and +10 ft. base speed for 1 minute. If you have at least a +8 to Acrobatics, double these bonuses.
- Armed and Dangerous: You may wield two specibi simultaneously with the same hands, so long as both specibi have the same hand(s) requirements.

#### Path of the Hurler

>[!quote] “Trust me, throw your weapon away.“

- Lobber: You arc your throws, ignoring cover bonuses on abilitechs made with thrown specibi. When making damaging abilitechs with thrown specibi, you can Aim on the attack and make it true damage as a reaction.
- Aerodynamics or Elastics: Your thrown specibi gain 15 ft. of range to ranged attacks and 5 ft. of range to melee attacks.
- Trick: You learn two out the following three maneuvers. You can use each maneuver P times per short rest. You can only use one maneuver per turn.

- Redo: When you miss a single-target attack with a thrown specibus, as a minor action, you may repeat the attack against that target with advantage, including any abilities/effects that were wasted on the failed shot.
- Sneaky Throw: When you land an attack with a thrown specibus, as a free action, make a Sleight of Hand check against your opponent’s Fortitude. If you break resistance, you also inflict Doom (Lvl).
- Deadeye: Before you make an attack with a thrown specibus, you may choose to make it a Deadeye attack. If you roll 16-20 on the d20 or critically hit, you deal +100% bonus damage (separate from the crit), but you take -50% instead if you do not.

- Bullfighter: After landing two single-target attacks with thrown specibi on a target, the third such attack on the same target has +1 die size and any stat mods it adds to damage are added an additional time.
- Counterpoint: Once per strife, as a free action, when an enemy takes a reaction or rapid action, make a basic abilitech with a thrown specibus against them, before their action is made. This basic abilitech deals P damage, and the target must pass an initiative roll against your attack roll, or the action is consumed with no effect.

#### Path of the Renegade

>[!quote] “Guys, the thermal drill, go get it.”

- Marked for Death: When you inflict Doom, it also inflicts DoT (P, 5 rounds). When a target with Rupture from you takes damage from an attacker (including yourself), if Rupture's bonus damage was applied at least twice on that attacker's turn, any DoTs on the target immediately damage the target again (duration is unaffected).
- Surefire: When you use an abilitech or subpower that makes multiple attacks (at once or otherwise), you may make one less initial attack (if it immediately makes any) (but still consume any resources) to make the other attacks at advantage. If you would have disadvantage on the attacks, you may alternately remove the disadvantage.
- Black Market Overclock: Choose one:

- Automatics: Your Momentum abilitechs have a maximum of 6 attacks. Additionally, your basic abilitechs also add +1 bonus attack to Momentum abilitechs (you may still only gain +2 bonus attacks per turn) and no longer reset the bonus.
- Pinpoint: When you use Lunge abilitechs, for every additional 10 feet you moved towards the target before attacking, you may Assail as part of the action (up to thrice). Additionally, if your Lunge abilitech inflicts Doom, raise its magnitude by P.
- Technical: When using the #1 part of an Encore abilitech or an abilitech that Empowers (the condition) a subsequent abilitech, you can Aim or Assail as part of the action. The Aim or Assail lasts an extra round.

- Screwdriver Special: Once per round, when you land a single-target damaging attack, you may take -50% damage to inflict Rupture (2P, 1 round). If the attack already Ruptures, you may choose to make it non-stacking in exchange for raising its magnitude by 2P and duration by 2 rounds.
- Illegal Body Mod: Choose one:

- Extension: If an attack or ability you use generates a stackable or scaling hit bonus, hit malus, or stackable/scaling AC/resistance bonus/malus (Fade and Sunder count for this purpose), the initial bonus and its cap are increased by 2.
- Reverb: When you benefit from any bonus to your attack rolls or skill checks during a strife (including advantage) that lasts one round or less, you gain +1 to all attack rolls and skill checks afterwards for the duration of the strife. This may stack up to +3.

#### Path of the Subjugglator

>[!quote] “And his name is…!”

- Fast Hands: If you make a single-target combo attack with your major action, you may grapple as a minor action. If you can grapple as a major action by other means (such as Hookchain's Grab), you may use that as a minor action instead.
- Submission Hold: When you grapple a target, you may do this with both hands if your other hand is also free. While grappling a target with both hands, the target is Exposed and Impaired.
- Iron Vise: As a free action, you may inflict Fade (2) and Sunder (2) on a target that you are currently grappling. Fade and Sunder from Iron Vise stack with themselves from other sources.
- Psionic Enforcer: When you use psionic powers on a target that you are grappling, you have advantage on psionic attack rolls and can count any hands used to grapple them as being free for the purposes of using psionic powers against them.
- Punch Down: As a minor action, you may inflict Pd4 damage on a target you are grappling. If you can already damage a target you are grappling as a minor action, take +1 die size to it instead.

#### Path of a Thousand Cuts

>[!quote] “As many times as it takes.”

- Flurry Stance: While you are in the Flurry Stance, whenever you make an attack roll with a damaging abilitech or subpower, you make two of it at -50% damage each, rounding up. You cannot use an attack that uses rounds/charges, makes multiple attack rolls, automatically hits, or deals damage after the initial attack. Both attacks consume the same action and resources, if any.

- Controlled Flurry: When you are in Flurry Stance, the two attacks may be different attacks, as long as both have the same cost, if any. You cannot make an attack you otherwise cannot make (e.g. you cannot combo attack as a minor action and a major action attack alongside it), but the split actions still only cost as if you only did one of them. [Requires Flurry Stance]

- Relentless: If you miss an attack roll with a specibus or subpower, your next attack roll with either one this strife has advantage.
- Sharp Strikes: You add +P damage to all damage rolls with abilitechs or subpowers.
- Torrent of Blows: When you deal damage to a target (direct or indirect) thrice in one round, you automatically hit them a fourth time for 2P damage. You may do this multiple times per round, but this fourth attack does not count as one for this Step.

#### Path of the Tracer (keystone)

>[!quote] “I’ve got you in my sights.”

Target Lock: When you take any Step in Path of the Tracer, you gain an ability called Trace. As a major action, you trace a target you can see. You always know their exact location, and this effect lasts for 1 minute or until the target reaches 0 HP. Additionally, your next successful attack against that target deals 100% bonus damage. You may only have one target Traced at a time.

- Improved Tracking: Attack rolls against Traced targets have one d4 Aim die or +1 die size to an existing Aim die.

- Advanced Tracking: Attack rolls against Traced targets instead have one d6 Aim die or +1 die size to all existing Aim dice, and also gain advantage. [Requires Improved Tracking]

- Trigonometry: Your attacks against Traced targets ignore flat hit maluses and disadvantage.
- Delta Lock: Trace also inflicts Doom (P) and may be performed as part of a non-damaging single target major action that does not roll a d20.
- Vital-Point Targeting: When you deal bonus percentage damage to a Doomed target, you may add Doom's value an additional time for each 100% bonus damage (as crits already add Doom again, a crit would now add Doom twice).

#### Path of the Warden

>[!quote] “I told you I would tell you my names."

Adalruna: Path of the Warden uses a resource called Runic Points (RP). You gain 1 RP for each Step taken in this Path, and RP is regained on a short or long rest. Some Steps in this Path are runes that can be supercharged; supercharging a rune costs 1 RP and 2P hit points besides whatever action cost is specified in the Step.

- Runes of Frost: You gain 2P temporary hit points at the start of a strife. The runes can be supercharged as a free action to gain 4P temp HP.
- Runes of Thunder: If a damaging melee attack adds your Strength or Dexterity mod, add either modifier again, of your choice, to the damage roll. The runes can be supercharged as a minor action to either Daze (1 round) all targets within 30 feet, or double Daze (1 round) one target within 30 feet.
- Runes of Fog: You have +1 to AC/resistances. The runes can be supercharged as a reaction to impose disadvantage on all attacks against you for 2 rounds.
- Runes of Blood: Once per short rest, as a minor action, you enter a martial trance, gaining +2 to hit and AC/resistances for 1 minute. The runes can be supercharged as a minor action to reactivate this trance when out of uses.

- Runes of Snow: You have +1 to hit and crit range against any targets within a range equal to your base speed. The runes can be supercharged as a free action to mark an enemy within said range, granting an additional +3 to hit against that target for 1 minute.

#### Path of the Zweihander

>[!quote] “Practice chivalry and learn art which adorns you and will glorify you in battle.”

- Hurricane: Once per strife, as a major and minor action, you perform three melee basic abilitechs and/or melee at-will psionic attacks, in any combination across known specibi/powers regardless of hand limits or currently equipped specibi, all of them with disadvantage.
- Close and Personal: When you make a damaging attack against a target within a range equal to half your base speed or less, you may use a reaction to deal an additional Pd2 damage. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Bloodthirst: Whenever you deal damage with a two-handed melee attack, you also inflict DoT (P physical damage, 5 rounds).
- Wind Up: As a minor action, the first damaging attack with a two-handed melee attack on your next turn deals an additional Pd6 damage, but reduce your base speed by 10 feet next turn. This effect cannot be stacked, any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Mordhau: Your two-handed melee attacks with weapons inflict Sunder (2), and your two-handed melee attacks with psionics inflict Fade (2).

### Strategist

>[!quote] "I love it when a plan comes together."

#### Path of Abraxas

>[!quote] “Ich wollte ja nichts als das zu leben versuchen, was von selber aus mir heraus wollte.”

- Open Floor Samba: Once per strife, as a minor action or as part of rolling for initiative, expend a lesser slot to make two psionic attack rolls, both against all targets within 30 feet, one targeting Fortitude, other Will. For each target, if you break Fortitude, inflict Exposed (1 round). For Will, Impaired (1 round). If you break both, the Impair becomes an Incapacitation (1 round).
- Railbird: Once per short rest, as a free action on your turn, make an attack roll against a target within 50 feet, targeting Reflex. If you break resistance, you steal their minor action, removing their minor action on their next turn and gaining an extra minor action to use on your turn at any point for the duration of that strife.
- Zodiac Age: Choose one:

- Phantom Outline: If you perform one or more damaging attacks as part of a full-round action, for each attack made, move 10 feet after the action resolves (or add 10 feet to the distance moved if it already does), to a maximum of 50 feet. You may then Avert as part of the action with +1 die size.
- Psi Rider: When you spend a lesser slot as part of an ability that requires landing an attack, you can spend a minor action to Empower your next attack roll. If the ability already spent a minor action, you can spend your reaction and 10 feet of speed instead.

- Royal Fork: When you land a damaging attack that inflicts Daze, you can remake the attack roll against the target's Will. If you break resistance, you trade Daze for Weakened (1 round).
- Sinclair's Psychic Avenger: When you land a single-target critical hit, you may deal Pd2+PCM damage on a different target within 50 feet of the critically hit target. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.

#### Path of the Acrobat

 >[!quote] “There is elegance in all the Ojutai do—even their killing.”

- Acrobatic Strike: Once per strife, when you land a combo melee attack as a minor action, make an Acrobatics or Intimidation check as a free action against that target's Reflex. If you break resistance, the target is knocked Prone. If you have at least a +8 to Acrobatics or Intimidation, you also impose one d4 Block die or add +1 die size to an existing Block die instead.
- Shadow Boxing: Once per round, when you Dash or move by any means besides a move action, you may make a finesse melee attack against all targets within range at any point during that movement. This attack deals P physical damage. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Leap Over: After making a major action combo attack, make an Athletics or Acrobatics check as a minor action. You jump a distance equal to the check (rounded to the nearest multiple of 5). You can move through other creatures' space when jumping, but cannot end your turn in it.
- Blur: If you move more than your base speed by any means this round, you have Aegis (P) against the next instance of damage you take. When you use Defend, you gain Aegis (P, 1 round) and half cover (or +2 to cover bonuses) against all attacks, for 1 round.
- Tripwire Binding: Once per strife, as a major action, make an Acrobatics check against a target within 60 feet, targeting Reflex. If you break resistance, the target is Crippled (half) for 1 minute.

#### Path of the Analyst

>[!quote] “I’m coming up with 32.33 uh, repeating, of course, percentage of survival.”

- Expose Weakness: Once per round, when you use a skill check to break a target's resistance or beat their check, you also inflict Rupture (P, 1 round) on the target or extend an existing Rupture's duration by 1 round.
- Signal Denial: As a major action, make an Engineering or Occult check against a target within 50 feet, targeting Fortitude. If you break resistance, for 1 minute, the target has disadvantage on skill checks, cannot gain or grant positive conditions/effects (such as temp HP or Empowered), takes -50% bonus damage gained from Assail, count as an ally to others, nor count others as allies. You can only signal jam one target at a time.
- Fire Support: You have INT+P bonus damage to all damage rolls made against targets adjacent to an ally. If that ally has a block radius, you can use it on any targets within that radius.
- Combined Arms: Once per damage roll, when an ally benefits from a beneficial effect conveyed by you, or you benefit from an effect conveyed by an ally, add INT+P bonus damage.
- Blackjack: As a major action, make an Investigation check against a target within 30 feet, targeting Fortitude. If you beat their resistance, the target is Incapacitated for 1 minute or until damaged. Usable once per target per short rest.

#### Path of the Dancer

>[!quote] “Are we human?”

Khachaturian's Encore: Path of the Dancer uses a resource called Dancer Points (DP). You gain 2 DP for each Step taken in this Path, and DP is regained on a short or long rest.

- Provocative Dance: As a major and minor action, spend 2 DP and make a Performance check against a target within 50 feet, targeting Will. If you break resistance, the target is Exposed and Incapacitated for 1 minute or until they take damage. If you fail to break resistance, the target is only Exposed. Alternately, you may target everyone within 50 feet, but the conditions only last for 1 round or until they take damage.
- Marin Karin: As a major action, spend 2 DP and make a Persuasion check against an adjacent target, targeting Will. If you break resistance, the target is compelled to act as you bid them for 3 rounds, though they will not take suicidal or impossible actions. If you fail to break resistance, they are Exposed and Impaired for the duration. Usable once per strife per target.
- Feign Surrender: As a reaction, spend 1 DP make a Deception check against all targets within 50 feet, targeting Will. For each target, if you break resistance, they have disadvantage to hit you. If an attack is made by or against you, you have advantage to hit for 1 round, but any disadvantage is lost and you cannot reuse this Step while that advantage lasts. Lasts 1 minute or until the advantage kicks in.
- Wait Your Turn: As a minor action, spend 1 DP and make an Intimidation check against all targets within 50 feet, targeting Will. For each target, if you break resistance, the target is Stuck (1 round).
- All Eyes on Me: As a major action, spend 1 DP and make a Performance check. All allies within 50 feet have advantage on attack rolls and skill checks while the effect is active. While the performance is ongoing, your allies may check Performance or use yours in place of Stealth and Distract checks. Lasts for 1 minute, but is inactive if you cannot be seen.

#### Path of Harmony (keystone)

>[!quote] “Harmony makes small things grow, lack of it makes great things decay.”

Enlightenment: Path of Harmony uses a resource called Balance Points (BP). You have a maximum of 5 BP when you enter this Path. You gain 1 BP whenever you land an attack roll or skill check, up to 2 BP per round. You lose all BP after 1 minute out of a strife. Additionally, whenever you add stat modifiers to a damage roll, you add your Wisdom modifier as well.

- Unwavering Stance: You may enter the Unwavering Stance only by resting for 1 minute outside of a strife. While you are in this stance, you can impose one d6 Block die as a reaction against attacks targeting your Fortitude or Will. As a free action, you may exit the Unwavering stance to take a Block die's maximum instead of rolling.
- Mantrika Mahakala: Your damaging attacks inflict Doom (P). You can add Doom's value an additional time if you spent 5 BP as part of the attack. Whenever you inflict Doom or attack/grapple a Doomed or grappled target, you may Assail and gain an additional BP from it. You cannot gain more than 2 BP per round.
- Mental Discipline: Select a psionic subpower. If you don't know it, you learn it. If you know it, the at-will and lesser versions have +1 die size. Either way, you may use Wisdom when casting it. You may spend 5 BP to cast the subpower as if you expended (and counts as) a lesser slot.
- Moment of a Perfect Mind: Whenever you damage a target, you can spend 5 BP (or as part of an ability that already spends 5 BP) to intensify the damage done; for each different stat's mod added to the damage roll, add that stat mod again. This then becomes true damage and inflicts Lethal (3*Lvl).
- Insightful Attacks: When you spend BP, you gain a damage bonus for the ability that spent it. You add your Wis mod for 2 BP spent, twice your mod for 4 BP, or thrice for 5 BP. Alternately, you may spend BP as a free action to trigger this ability.

#### Path of the Infernal

>[!quote] “There never was an apple, in Adam's opinion, that wasn't worth the trouble you got in for eating it.”

Original Sin: Path of the Infernal uses a resource called Sin Points (SP). You gain 2 SP for each Step taken in this Path, and SP is regained on a short or long rest.

- Intercessory Chant: When you Dash, Defend, Help, or use a minor action to Aim, Avert, or Assail, as part of the action you may spend 1 SP and intone something apropos to heal yourself or an ally within 50 feet for Pd3 hit points. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Lovely Little Lies: Tell a lie as a major action, spending 1 SP to make an Investigation or Insight check against a target within 50 feet, targeting Will. If you break resistance, the target is Exposed and Impaired for 1 minute, until it ends its turn adjacent to you, or pinches itself as a full-round action for Pd4 damage.
- See No Evil: As a major action, spend 2 SP and make an Engineering or Perception check, insidiously gesticulating at all targets of choice within 50 feet. For 1 round, any target that acts against you or ends their turn within line of sight of you is Blinded (2 rounds). Alternately, if they have not yet moved, they may make a Perception check as a move action to clear it. On your next turn, you may use the check's result in place of an attack roll against a target who was not Blinded from this Step.
- Devil's Due: As a major action, spend 2 SP and make an Occult or Animal Handling check against a target within 50 feet, targeting Fortitude. If you break resistance, the target gains DoT (2P, 1 minute) as illness strikes. If the target dies, it jumps to the nearest enemy within 50 feet. If there are none available, if you are within range, it jumps to you and heals for 2P HP for every jump (including this one).
- Fiendish Composure: When at half HP (ignoring temp HP) or lower, your charm and wit under pressure grant a +2 bonus to your skill checks in a strife. This is raised to +4 for checks made as part of a major action.

#### Path of the Inquisitor

>[!quote] “The present fate of men may be summed up in three words: Unrest, Confusion, Misery!"

- Keen-Eyed Attack: As a minor action or as part of rolling for initiative, you may make an Insight, Investigation, or Deception check against a target, targeting Will. If you succeed, you may add Pd4 damage to a future attack against that foe. This benefit lasts until used, for 1 minute, or another check is made.
- Moonmarked: As a major action, aggressively gesture at a target. Your next attack roll against them has advantage, you can Aim at the target as a free action once per round, and you ignore any hit maluses on attacks against them, for 1 minute or you use Moonmarked on another target.
- Karamazov's Mien: When you Avert, you can choose to place it on an enemy. When you place Block dice on an enemy in any way, you may alternately Cripple (X, 1 round) them for magnitude equal to the die roll times five.
- Witch Hunt: If a creature uses an action to generate a beneficial effect, you have advantage to hit them for 1 round.
- Eye for an Eye: Once per strife, as a reaction to being hit by a damaging attack roll, make an Occult, Medicine, or Deception check against that attack roll. If you beat the roll, any conditions imposed by your next action (or an ally's) against them has their duration extended by 1 round.

#### Path of the Mastermind (keystone)

>[!quote] “ALL ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU!” (Editor’s note: keikaku means plan)

Master of Tactics: When you take any Step in Path of the Mastermind, you can Help as a minor action with a range of 100 feet. Additionally, you also add your Intelligence modifier when rolling for initiative. You also gain the Spark of Genius ability; once per short rest, you may modify any d20 roll by adding or subtracting your Intelligence modifier from the roll.

- Calculating: When using or benefitting from Avert or Aim, take +2 die sizes and an extra die of the same, and using or benefitting from Assail grants +1 die size as well. Up to three such effects in any combination may be active at once.
- Redlight: In a strife, passing Discern checks against the target imposes Lethal (P, stacks to 3P) for the duration of the strife. If you Scrutinized the target beforehand, it immediately goes to Lethal (3P).
- Anatomical Accuracy: If you are attacking a target's anatomy, you can ignore either the hit or the crit penalty. If you roll for damage without targeting anatomy, add INT+P to the roll.
- Outmaneuver: When rolling for initiative or as a major action, switch positions with another target. If the target is unwilling, make a Discern check against their Will; if you break resistance, switch anyway. The range of Outmaneuver is equal to one and a half times your speed. Once per strife, you can Outmaneuver as part of Discerning, if the target is already Discerned.
- Inductive Reasoning: When landing a non-damaging ability (or take -100% damage to a damaging one), you may inflict the Breakdown (0, stacks to 5, 1 minute) condition on the target. Breakdown counts as either both Fade and Sunder, or Setback, chosen when inflicted. Whenever a Brokendown creature is Discerned, its magnitude increases by 1; if you already Scrutinized the target before inflicting it, it starts at Breakdown (3).

#### Path of the Mystic

>[!quote] “The magic of old must be preserved. No matter how feared.”

- Anchor of Light: As a major action, expend a lesser slot and make a psionic attack against a target within 60 feet, targeting Will. If you break resistance, a golden chain shackles them; draw a 10 ft. radius around the target that lasts 2 rounds. If the target is ever outside this, they take Pd8+PCM damage. It deals half damage if it expires naturally or the target spends a major action to break it. This is a lesser slot subpower.
- Runic Warding: When you confer some sort of beneficial effect or remove negative effects from an ally, the ally also gains Aegis (P, 1 round).
- Cursed Mirror: As a major action, make a psionic attack roll against a target within 60 feet, targeting Will. If you break resistance, whenever you take damage, up to P damage is transferred from you to the target for for 3 rounds. If you have any negative conditions of duration 2 minutes or less when making the attack, duplicate them onto the target as well.
- Witching Hour: When you impose an effect with a duration of 2 rounds or longer, as a minor action, increase its duration by 1 round.
- Leviathan's Maw: Once per short rest, as a free action, you may brand a target for consumption for the rest of the strife. Once per round per attacker, damaging the target heals the attacker for their Con mod.

#### Path of the Operator

>[!quote] "Bravo Six, going dark."

- Flank Tactics: When you make attack rolls or skill checks against a target, if said target (or all targets if multiple) is adjacent to a minion or ally, or within an ally's block radius, take +2 to the attack roll or skill check.
- Covert Ops: You are immune to Blind, can perceive your surroundings normally as if you had eyes, but without relying on light or sight, and gain +4 to Stealth checks (and Distract if not using Stealth for it) in a strife when using darkness, psionic illusions, or other obscuring effects.
- Shadow Ops: When you use a psionic subpower as a major action, you can expend a lesser slot as a minor action to become Invisible for 1 round (and you may retroactively count the major action as being made while Invisible in this way).
- Master of Ambush: Once per round, a single-target damaging attack against a target that has yet to take a turn in the strife, or is Incapacitated, deals an additional Pd4 damage. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- False Flags: As part of rolling for initiative, you may move up to a distance equal to the initiative roll (rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 if necessary). You then gain +1 to your attack rolls and skill checks for every 10 on the check until the end of the first non-surprise round.

#### Path of the Protagonist (keystone)

>[!quote] “Style as a hallmark of victory.”

Dramatis Personae: Path of the Protagonist uses a resource called Luck Points (LP). When you take any Step in this Path, you have a maximum of 2 LP, plus 1 LP per Step taken in this Path, with LP regained at the start of a strife. You also gain the Heroic Pose ability that can only be used in a strife. As a major action, you pose dramatically, refilling all LP and gaining advantage on your next attack roll or skill check.

- Dramatic Flourish: Spend 3 LP when making a damaging attack roll to gain Pd3+CHA bonus damage. You may either heal for half that bonus damage or deal half the bonus damage to the target on a miss. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- A Certain Set of Skills: Choose one:

- Silver Tongue: When using Aim or Avert, you may spend 1 LP to take +1 to the bonus. If you have at least a +8 in a Charisma skill, this bonus rises by +1, up to +4 for three skills with at least +8.
- Smooth Criminal: When using Distract, you may spend 1 LP to use Deception instead of Stealth, take advantage on the check, and gain the crit bonus as a bonus to AC/resistances against the next attack made against you.

- Vicious Retort: As a reaction to being attacked, you may spend 2 LP to make a damaging basic abilitech or at-will subpower attack, dealing Pd3+CHA damage.
- Rising Tempo: You regain 1 LP after using an Encore (2nd) abilitech, a lesser/greater slot subpower, or an ability benefitting from Heroic Pose's advantage. Heroic Pose can now be used as part of a non-damaging major action that is Reload, Encore (1st), makes a skill check against resistance or DC, rolls no d20, or requires more than a major action.
- Star Power: When you make an attack roll or skill check in a strife and benefit from one or more flat bonuses, you may spend 1 LP to add one of those bonuses to your AC/resistances for 1 round. Alternately, when you are targeted by an attack against your AC/resistances and have flat bonuses to it (including bonuses from this Step), you may spend 1 LP to add one of those bonuses to your attack rolls and skill checks for 1 round.

#### Path of the Sawbones

>[!quote] “Dammit, I’m a doctor, not a soldier!”

- Field Surgery: As a major action, perform a rather gory quick field surgery that heals an adjacent ally for 2Pd4+WIS hit points, with +1 die size for every 10 on the check. You may take -50% healing to use this on yourself or at 60 ft. range, by throwing pills, gel capsules, magic beans, or whatever your SM lets you get away with. You have a number of uses of Field Surgery per long rest equal to your total modifier in Medicine.

- Time Out!: Once per strife, as a reaction to an ally being damaged, you may call a time out. Attacks against you and the ally have disadvantage for 2 rounds or until you or the ally perform a damaging or healing action; the disadvantage-ending action has +1 die size to the damage done, +2 sizes if healing.
- Intense Study: When you Discern, you spy a weak point on a creature, gaining +1 to hit for 1 minute. If you have at least a +8 to Medicine, you instead get one d3 Aim die that lasts 1 minute, or +1 die size and 1 minute duration on an existing die. Calling out this weak point allows allies in earshot to benefit from this bonus.
- Pills Here!: As a minor action, throw adrenaline/coffee at an ally within 60 feet, allowing them to take their turn during yours instead of at their normal initiative step. The player then skips the turn they would've taken normally. You may use this on yourself to instead Dash for this turn. Usable once per three rounds.
- Tranquilizer: When you land a damaging attack, you may take -50% damage to inflict Weaken (1 round). Alternately, take -100% damage to Weaken (2 rounds). If you have at least a +8 to Medicine, you also Impair them for the duration.

#### Path of the Skulker (keystone)

>[!quote] Still can't find that quote.

Hidden Hand: When you take any Step in Path of the Skulker, you gain an ability called Ambush. When you Ambush, you Distract but you have +2 to the skill check, and if your opposed check is successful, you also gain a +2 hit bonus on the next attack. Whenever you Distract, you may choose to Ambush instead (such as through Chained Stratagems).

- Improved Ambush: Your Ambush gains +1 to hit, crit range, and skill checks. You can Ambush as part of rolling for initiative (and may use the initiative roll in place of the check), and Ambush from this may be held until used or end of strife.
- Sneak Attack: If you make a damaging attack that benefits from Ambush, it has +1 die size to damage. If the target has at least two negative conditions, it becomes +2 die sizes instead.
- Hammer and Anvil: When you Ambush a target within an ally's block radius, you also inflict your hit bonus as a hit malus on the target for 1 round. If your Ambush is successful, you also grant its benefits to that block radius ally.
- Preparation: The benefits of Ambush now last until the end of your next turn. Additionally, when you Dash, Defend, or use a non-damaging abilitech or subpower as a major action (or perform any of these as part of a major action), you can Ambush as part of it, and have advantage on the skill check when doing so.
- Aerial Traverse: When you Ambush a target, you can move 10 feet as part of the action. Alternately, when you use a minor action that lets you move in any way, you can Ambush as part of that action.

#### Path of the Tactician

>[!quote] “First, distract target. Then block his blind jab. Counter with cross to left cheek. Discombobulate.”

- As a Team!: Once per round, when an ally makes a skill check, you give them advantage on the check.
- Focus Fire: When you Aim as a minor action, you can instead inflict Fade or Sunder on a target. The magnitude of this condition is 1, plus 1 per die size above d3 that the Aim die would've had.
- Chained Stratagems: Once per round, when you use a major action to Dash, Grapple, Shove, Defend, Help, or Ready (or perform it as part of one), an ally may also Aim, Assail, Avert, Distract, or move 10 feet. Alternately, you may do one of those five listed actions instead, if an ally performs one of the triggering actions.
- Incite Treason: Once per strife, as a minor action, declare an enemy within 50 ft. to be suspect and make an Acrobatics, Investigation, Animal Handling, or Persuasion check. All other enemies are Impaired (2 rounds) by the accusation unless they pass an opposing Insight check as a reaction or one of them attacks the suspect (regardless of if it hits or misses).
- Loss Prevention: Whenever you directly heal yourself or an ally, it has +P bonus healing. When you or an ally heal to full HP, half the excess HP is converted to temporary hit points (up to 2P temp HP). Healing from short rests also counts, with allies able to benefit if you are present.

#### Path of the Vanguard

>[!quote] “But from now on, we fight as a Clan. No warrior will go into battle alone. Where one fights, we all fight!”

- March!: As a minor action, you or an ally immediately moves up to half their base speed, ignoring difficult terrain. If you move as part of any action other than a move action, you can do this to increase the distance moved by that half base speed instead; if you do this for an ally, they can forego immediately moving to use it in the same way on their turn.
- Defensive Youth Roll: Once per three rounds, as a reaction to being attacked, you may grant yourself Aegis (P), then move 10 feet after the attack has resolved. If you did not take damage, you move 20 feet instead. Alternately, you let an ally do this instead, with you or them spending the reaction.
- Tactical Deployment: If you Dash as a major action in a strife, you may instead let an ally immediately move for that bonus speed. If you have not yet moved this turn, you may forego your movement to let an ally move for half the foregone speed.
- Incoming!: As a reaction, you and all allies gain +2 AC/resistances for 1 round. If another ability is used that also grants bonus AC and/or resists to the beneficiaries while active, it gains a +1 bonus.
- Triage Protocols: When you heal a target during a strife, increase the healing done by your Level for every +2 crit range on yourself or the target. Twice per short rest, this healing is Empowered and grants Aegis (P, 1 round).

### Sentinel/Slayer

>[!quote] “Don’t you know who I am?”

#### Path of the Arcane Avenger

>[!quote] “Life being what it is, one dreams of revenge.”

- Akedah Narrative: As part of rolling for initiative, spend up to three lesser slots for storytime. For each slot spent, pick a target and Expose and Incapacitate them for 1 round.
- Twicefold Betrayal: As a major action, expend a greater slot and sap energy from all enemies within a 50 ft. radius. Each enemy gains Rupture (P, 1 minute, stackable). For every enemy Ruptured, you gain Aegis (P, 1 minute), up to Aegis (5P).
- The Eleventh Rite: Whenever you expend a lesser slot in a strife, you gain P temporary hit points. This increases to 2P if the lesser slot dealt no damage or was spent through a Step.
- Catalytic Lock Engaged: Whenever you expend a lesser slot in a strife, pick a target with DoT within range of whatever spent that slot; they take damage equal to the sum of those DoTs' magnitudes (duration is unaffected). If the lesser slot use inflicts a DoT, do not count it for this, but add +P to its magnitude.
- Melancholic Ire: While you have temporary hit points or are Warded, whenever you generate Block dice as a reaction, your next damaging attack becomes Empowered.

#### Path of the Berserker (keystone)

>[!quote] “Rip and tear, until it is done.”

Berserker Stance: You learn the Berserker Stance. While in this stance, you have Ward (P). The stance lasts 1 minute or if you end your turn without having attacked or grappled a target or having taken damage since the start of your last turn.

- Improved Guardian: Choose one:

- Opportunism: You gain the Opportunist milestone. If you already have it, you can choose to Assail as part of the reaction, or deal -100%  damage to Expose the target for 1 round instead.
- Controller: You gain the Controller milestone. If you already have it, you can either gain another +1 die size on the damage roll for a total of +2 die sizes, or forego the die sizes to pick one negative condition inflicted by the attack; this condition's duration is extended by 1 round.

- Fire and Iron: When you deal damage, you may spend some or all of your temp HP to add it as bonus damage, including temp HP you would gain from the attack. You also add +P to any Assails you benefit from and any temp HP you gain.
- Dangersense: When you Avert, it has +2 die sizes and lasts for 1 round. Once per round, if an attack with Block dice lands on you anyway, you may Assail as a free action.
- Bloodborne Rally: In a strife, if you take any damage outside your turn, at the start of your next turn, if you damage your attacker back and the damage roll has any flat bonuses (such as Assail), you can heal for the sum of all such bonuses, up to the highest triggering damage that target dealt to you in a single attack.
- Furious Strike: When you miss a major action attack roll, you may spend 2P hit points to Empower your next major action attack roll that lands. Alternately, take -5 before making an attack roll to Empower it. When you gain Empowered in this way, it has +1 die size.

#### Path of the Carmine

>[!quote] “I sectioned my tibia for the soup.”

- Iron Baptism: As a free action on your turn, roll a Hit Die (without spending it) with advantage, then reduce your HP and max HP by the roll. You gain Regen (average HD size minus three plus mods, 4 rounds) and your next four damage rolls gain half the max HP reduction as bonus damage.
- Vermillion Wind: Once per short rest, as a free action, your blood begins to boil, gaining +P to all damage dealt, +P to all healing dealt and taken, and dealing 2P damage on a missed damaging attack (or +2P damage if already has this) for 1 minute. However, you spend P hit points at the start of each turn. If you would be reduced to 0 HP this way, you instead go to 1 HP and end the effect.
- Thanergetic Byproduct: When you take at least 2P damage through self-inflicted means or reduce your max HP through a Step, you may choose to take P true damage to Empower your next damage roll.
- Lavish Bloodburst: Once per turn, when you add Pd(X) dice as a bonus to a damage roll, count how many die sizes it is above Pd3. You may take P times that number (min 1) (if 2Pd(X), multiply by 2 too) true damage to HP, then add +2 die sizes to both the damage roll and the bonus dice. If you are somehow adding multiple sets of bonus dice, you must take the highest possible self-damage but may add +2 die sizes to all sets.
- Wreath of Higanbanas: As a major action, or as part of one that heals another, reduce your HP and max HP by 2P to heal an adjacent (or within block radius) target for Pd4+CON hit points (or add it to the healing done). Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.

#### Path of the Heavy Weapons Guy

>[!quote] “Strength and muscle and jungle work!”

Bullet Wizard: The Steps in Heavy Weapons Guy require a currently equipped weapon with rounds/charges in order to be used, and must be used on any steps that specify a basic abilitech. If a step requires you to spend rounds/charges, you must spend a minimum of one.

- Covering Fire: As a reaction, you may expend a basic abilitech’s worth of rounds/charges to impose one d4 Block die against an attack against AC. When equipped with a weapon with rounds/charges, your block radius becomes the weapon's normal range.

- Danger Zone: When you make an attack that uses rounds/charges, if you generate Block dice on the same turn, you can impose it on the target and everyone within 5 ft. of them. If it isn't single-target, you instead impose it on all targets. [Requires Covering Fire]

- Ballistic Bafflement: Once per strife, you may throw… something (spare bullets, an empty mag, a full mag, the gun itself, a mag about mags…), making a basic abilitech targeting Will that costs no rounds/charges. If you break resistance, it only deals damage equal to any stat mods that would be added, but the enemy is baffled by your bullshit and is Crippled (half, 2 rounds) and Impaired (2 rounds). This counts as non-damaging for the purposes of synergizing with other Steps and effects.
- Ordnance Fire: If you have not yet moved this turn, you may spend all but 10 feet of speed to Daze (1 round) with your ranged attack rolls this turn. Alternately, spend all your speed as a minor action Sunder (3) instead.
- Ballistic Evidence: When at half HP (ignoring temp HP) or lower, you have Ward (Lvl/2).

#### Path of the Herald

>[!quote] “White smoke smoulders off its shimmering surface, and the ring of soundless lightning is reflected in its glossy shell."

- Primordial Challenge: Once per strife, as part of rolling for initiative or a minor action, make an attack roll (using any stat) against a target, targeting Will. If you break resistance, you compel the target into a duel. You and the target are both Exposed for 5 rounds or one side is reduced to 0 HP. If Exposed is removed prematurely from either side or a third party attacks either of you, it also ends, but the responsible target is then Exposed for the rest of the strife.
- Apostle's Due: Once per round, when you generate Block dice by any means, all adjacent targets of choice gain Lethal (P, stacks to 4P). If you have a block radius, impose it on all targets of choice within the radius instead.
- Dark Outpacing Light: When you move as part of an abilitech, you teleport the equivalent distance. Your abilitechs with the Lunge property also inflict Lethal (P) or Lethal (equal to Doom inflicted with it) and have +1 die size.
- End of Everything: As a major action, set yourself alight with DoT (P true damage, 5 rounds). When you take damage from this, so do all targets of choice within your block radius or 30 ft. radius of choice. These targets are considered to have DoT (but not any other special effects attached to it). As part of the action, you can also apply any other DoTs you can use as a major and/or minor action at that time (including any resources), optionally making them true damage. If this would reduce you to 0 HP, you instead go to 1 HP and the DoT(s) end.
- Inevitable Ruin: When you use or impose Block dice, you also Assail. Assail from this still deals its damage even if the attack misses.

#### Path of the Seraph (keystone)

>[!quote] “Provoking black clouds in isolation!”

Uprising: When you take any Step in Path of the Seraph, you gain an ability called Aerial Break. When you inflict forced movement (or Prone) through a damaging abilitech or subpower, you can inflict the Airborne condition instead (or additionally, if knocked Prone), which suspends the target(s) 5 feet midair until the end of your turn. While Airborne, targets cannot take reactions, all attack rolls and skill checks against them have +1 to hit per 10 feet of forced movement (stacks across multiple instances, to +6), and Prone is modified to grant advantage on all attack rolls instead. When landing a damaging attack you can take -1 die size to push the target 10 feet (or an additional 10 feet).

- Ultraviolence: Your first damaging attack against an Airborne target has +2 to hit. This bonus increases by +2 with every subsequent attack this turn, up to +6 to hit.
- Closing Rain: As a free action on your turn, you gain speed (up to your base speed) for 1 round, taking -1 to AC/resistances for every 10 ft. for that duration, up to -4. Alternatively, you take -4 to AC/resistances to gain +4 to hit for 1 round.
- Angelic Volition: If you make multiple attacks at once as part of an abilitech or subpower, or an ability to the same effect, you may make one additional attack but this attack deals -50% damage. If it makes one attack per target for some number of targets, you instead gain +1 die size on those attacks.
- Jump Cancel: If you end your turn with at least half your base speed unused, until the start of your next turn, as a reaction to an incoming attack roll you may impose disadvantage on it.
- Legendary Dark Knight: Once per short rest, as a free action, you use a non-trademark infringing devil trigger, gaining +1 crit range and +1 die size to all damage for 3 rounds. You also choose one other Step you know that confers a benefit for a set duration between 3 rounds and 1 minute whose conditions (if any) are met, such as Runes of Blood or Catastrophe; you also gain this Step's effects for 3 rounds.

#### Path of the Serpent

>[!quote] “Slowly. Gently. This is how a life is taken.”

- Venomous Intent: When you Dash, Defend, or perform a non-damaging major action abilitech or subpower, your next damaging abilitech or subpower also inflicts DoT (P, 5 rounds).
- Accelerant: DoTs from your abilitechs and subpowers now stack an additional time. If the DoT was dealt by an Encore or slotted ability, you inflict two stacks instead.
- Plague Influx: When you inflict a DoT as part of a damaging attack but the target already has that DoT, you may instead add that DoT's magnitude as bonus damage. You may only do this once per round per DoT.
- Serpentine Guile: As a reaction to yourself Averting or having Avert used for you, you may move 5 feet. This is raised to 10 feet if the Block die would be d6 or higher.
- Coilbound: When you deal damage to a grappled target with a minor action, you may Aim or Distract (may use grappling skill instead of Stealth) as part of the action.

### Slayer/Strategist

>[!quote] “Oh honey, now who’s being stupid? I’ve got the most powerful weapon of all.”

#### Path of the Arbiter

>[!quote] “The weight of your sins will determine the weight of your punishment."

- Jurisprudence: When you inflict damage with a subpower, you also inflict Lethal (P, stacks to 3P).
- Stay of Execution: When you damage a target with Lethal, you may remove Lethal from the target and heal for half the removed magnitude. You may do this once per target per strife.
- Restraining Order: As a reaction, Cripple (5, 1 round) a target. You may expend a lesser slot to Cripple (15, 2 rounds) the target instead. This is a subpower.
- Deliberation: In a strife, when you use a non-damaging subpower as a major action, the damaging major action subpower next turn has +1 die size. If the first subpower expended a slot, the subpower is Empowered instead.
- Quash Dissent: Once per strife, when you use a minor action that commands minions to attack, or a minor action that damages a target you are grappling, make a grappling, Intimidation, or Performance check against the DC of all targets of choice in the strife. For each target, if you pass, you inflict Daze (2, 1 round) and Weaken (1 round).

#### Path of the Battlemaster (keystone)

>[!quote] “Taking the Void as the Way, you will see the Way as Void.”

Ni Ten Ichi Ryu: When you enter Path of the Battlemaster, choose a strife specibus. You are now proficient with this strife specibus and immediately learn all its basic abilitechs. You then learn a special attack for every Step you learn (including retroactively) as though it were any other specibus you know. Additionally, your abilitechs have +1 die size to damage, aim, and block dice.

- War on Three Fronts: For the purposes of wielding specibi and powers, you are considered to have a third hand with which to wield them. You may alternately use this third hand to add +1 die size to damage to an already-wielded specibus or power regardless of how many hands it normally uses.
- Master of Arms: Once on each of your turns, you may switch specibi as a free action. Whenever you switch to a specibus, you gain a bonus based on its tag. If it has multiple eligible tags, you may choose. You may only benefit from a bonus every other round.

- Brutality: Your next abilitech Dazes for 1 round, or Empowers your next damaging attack if non-damaging.
- Finesse: If the next abilitech used also has the Combo property, Assail once freely on both major and minor versions. Otherwise, you may Distract as part of the next damaging abilitech.
- Esoteric: Pick a condition inflicted by your next abilitech and extend its duration by 1 round.
- Reload: If you can Reload as a minor action, you may do so as part of the switch. Otherwise, take +1 die size to the next damage roll.

- Sync Kill: Once per strife, when you slay a creature with Lethal, if they are within range up to your base speed, you may move adjacent to them and slay them in an elaborate animation that heals you for half the Lethal's magnitude and grants either Aegis (P, 1 round) or Ward (P, 1 round).
- Ancient Stance: While in the Ancient Stance, when an attack against you misses, as a reaction you may make an attack (using any stat on any abilitech or subpower) against them. If you hit, they are knocked Prone. You may move 10 feet as part of the reaction, before or after making the attack roll.
- Sublime Excellence: Twice per short rest, when making an attack roll or skill check, you can add +2d4 or advantage to the roll, of your choice.

#### Path of the Broodmother

>[!quote] “Athel Loren shall not suffer the presence of Men, nor Orcs, nor Dwarfs, nor Beastmen."

- Apiary's Stinger Swarm: When making damaging attacks against multiple targets, you can add bees to it as a reaction, adding your Wisdom modifier to the damage roll. The bees then linger for 1 round, adding your Wisdom mod to any other damage rolls for that duration. This also applies to area of effect attacks, inundating the area with wonderful bees for 1 round to the same effect.
- Kill Command Ready: If you Defend, Help, or Shove as a major action, or your control specibus uses a non-damaging abilitech, its next abilitech is Empowered. Additionally, your control specibus minion has an extra 10P maximum hit points and +2 to its AC/resistances.
- Elemental Greenwrath: Whenever your minions add a stat mod to damage not in their base profile (such as Assail), they have +P to each such damage bonus. When they benefit from Doom, they can add its value an additional time.
- Nature's Guidance: When you generate Aim or Block dice, you can take -1 die size to give it to all your minions. If you do this as a major action, there is no penalty. If you have at least a +8 to Engineering, Medicine, or Survival, you have no penalty normally and get +1 die size for the major action.
- Pale Pendulum: As a major action, expend a lesser slot and make a psionic attack against a target within 60 feet, targeting Fortitude. If you break resistance, deal Pd3+PCM damage and inflict either Doom (P) or Ruptured (2P, 3 rounds, stackable), of your choice. This is a lesser slot subpower.

#### Path of the Host

>[!quote] “Through the nightly air stampedes a train of frothing black horses."

- Raging Howl: As a major action, spend one lesser slot to make a psionic attack roll against all targets within 100 feet, targeting Will as you, well, howl. For each target, if you break resistance, they are Weakened (3 rounds).
- Wolfpack: Choose one:

- Alpha Factor: You have +1 to attack rolls against targets for each of your minions that are adjacent to them, up to +4. You can suspend this until the end of your next turn as a minor action or reaction to give an ally advantage to hit for 1 round.
- Wall of Fangs: For each minion that starts their turn within movement range of an enemy, all of your minions' attacks gain a stacking +1 to hit, up to +6.

- War Bond: Your minions have an extra 2*Level maximum hit points. If the ability, subpower, etc that gives you a minion only gives you one, raise this to 5*Level for that minion. Once per round, when a minion lands a damaging hit or you use a minion to this effect, you also Assail.
- Hueste de Guerra: Once per strife, as a free action on your turn, select a target within 100 feet. The target is Exposed until the end of your turn. Alternately, all attacks against them have +1 crit range for 1 minute.
- Confluence: Choose one:

- Moonlit Night: When you summon a minion using a psionic subpower or after a short rest, you can choose to strengthen your bond with them, granting them the ability to Aim, Avert, or Assail on your behalf, once on each turn they act. Only one minion may be enhanced in this way at a time.
- Catastrophe: Once per short rest, as a major action, sacrifice a minion under your control, consigning them to a horrible fate in exchange for perks. You immediately heal for Lvl hit points and gain the same in maximum HP (may go above normal), then have +2 to hit, +1 crit range, and +1 die size to damage for 1 minute. You cannot use, resummon, or in any way recover this minion until you complete a short rest.

#### Path of the Outlaw

>[!quote] “My grandmother could shoot better than you, and not only is she blind, she's also dead.”

- Towering Arrogance: Twice per strife, when an attack roll misses you, a damaging attack roll of choice against them gains advantage.
- Sailor's Vernacular: Once per turn, when you pass a skill check against an enemy's DC or resistance, you also insult them for P true damage.
- In the Zone: After attacking or grappling as a major action, subsequent attack rolls and skill checks this turn add +3 to the roll.
- Blood in the Water: As a reaction to an enemy taking damage outside your turn, you may move 5 feet. You also gain an extra reaction per round that can only be used on reactions that allow you to move.
- Self-Aggrandization: Whenever you benefit from Assail, Doom, Rupture, or other bonuses to damage, you add +P to each of their total magnitudes (or +P per stat mod for Assail).

#### Path of the Pirate

>[!quote] “Yar har fiddle di dee. If I win the grapple, you're coming with me.”

- Grappling Cable: You gain +10 ft. to your grapple range. When you successfully grapple, you may pull yourself adjacent to the target. Alternately, when you Grapple, you may instead move an ally within grappling range to any other point also within range. You may substitute an object in place of a target, though the SM reserves the right to ask for a skill check.
- Holmgang: While you grapple a target, if you or the target(s) takes forced movement, you may force all others to move with it (up to your base speed), maintaining the grapple if you are still within grapple range at the end. When you inflict at least 10 feet of forced movement against a target, you also Expose them for 1 round.
- Boarding Hook: When you grapple a target as a major action, you can hook them as a minor action, inflicting DoT (P, duration of grapple) (or +P if you already inflict DoT with grappling). If the target attempts to break the grapple (or is automatically broken by some means), first, any DoTs damage the target again (duration is unaffected).
- I'm the Captain Now: If an ally benefits from an Assail or Distract not from you, gain +1 crit range for each benefit on your next turn. Additionally, when you benefit from Assail or Distract, for each your allies have +1 to crit against the target for 1 round.
- Hostage Situation: Once per round, when you are grappling someone and you take damage from someone you are not grappling, you scapegoat your grappled target (choosing one if you have multiple grappled), either reducing your damage taken by P or causing them to take P damage from the damaging attack.

#### Path of the Starhunter

>[!quote] “You are always and still a moth to folly's candle.”

- In Starlight Clad: When you perform a non-damaging major action given as a Step, or use a non-damaging major action that does not roll a d20 modified with the effects of at least one Step, your next damaging attack next turn has +1 die size.
- Fall Solar: When using a damaging melee attack, you may give it +1 die size, but a roll of 4 or less on the d20 causes a backlash, dealing half the base damage to yourself and all targets within the melee attack's range.
- Icarus Reimagined: When rolling for initiative, you may choose to inflict Doom (P) on yourself. If you do, you may add this Doom's magnitude to one damage roll per round. Bonus damage from this counts as Doom (and counts the target as Doomed) for the purposes of synergizing with other Steps and effects.
- Crying Suns: When you deal damage against a Doomed target that also has one or more DoTs, you may add Doom's magnitude an additional time.
- Fire, Walk With Me: When you land a damaging critical hit or deal at least +50% bonus damage in some way, heal yourself for 2P hit points.

#### Path of the Thaumaturge (keystone)

>[!quote] "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"

Awakening Dreamer: Path of the Thaumaturge uses a resource called Dreams. You have a maximum of 3 Dreams per Step taken in this Path, and your Dreams fully restore on a long rest. You may choose between the Eldritch Blast or Eldritch Smite basic abilitechs to learn on a strife specibus of your choice. Both are a major action to make an attack with your psionic casting stat. Eldritch Blast is a ranged attack with a range of 60 feet and Qd6+PCM damage, while Eldritch Smite is a melee attack with a range of 5 feet and Qd8+PCM damage. Either way, if the weapon is wielded in two hands, the chosen abilitech gains +1 die size.

- Magic is Real: Pick a psionic power and learn one subpower per Thaumaturge Step you know, including this one. You also learn one whenever you take more Steps in the future. If you learn all five Steps, you learn all subpowers in that power. When casting this power, you can expend a Dream in place of (and counts as) a lesser slot.
- Take Flight: You can expend a Dream as a free action to gain a fly speed of 30 feet for 1 minute. Alternately, you may expend a Dream as a minor action to become intangible for 1 round.
- Ogloparry: As a reaction, you may impose one d4 Block die against an attack against AC. If you can already impose Block dice via reaction, you add +1 die size to them instead. You can expend a Dream as part of this reaction to duplicate one of the Block dice and also impose disadvantage.
- Rainbow Triforce: As a major and minor action, expend a Dream to make three psionic attack rolls, against a single target within 60 feet, each targeting a different resistance. For each hit, inflict Pd2 damage and one of the following: Exposed (1 round), Impaired (1 round), Stuck (1 round), extend an existing condition's duration by 1 round. This is a special abilitech and subpower.
- Hopes and Dreams: As part of using a major and/or minor action that does not roll a d20, you can expend a Dream to gain Regen (P, 3 rounds).

#### Path of the Wrestler

>[!quote] “Blood is thicker than new blood, dude!”

- Big Hands: You may grapple creatures of larger size categories than you without disadvantage. You also gain a climb speed equal to your base speed.

- Huge Hands: You may grapple creatures three or more size categories larger than you without disadvantage. Additionally, you have advantage to attack creatures you grapple. [Requires Big Hands]

- Turnbuckle Thrash: Whenever you inflict damage through forced movement, you may add your Strength mod to the damage done. If you can grapple with another skill, you may use that skill's stat's mod instead. You may use Aim dice on skill checks to inflict forced movement as though it were an attack roll.
- Submission Artist: Any creatures you grapple have Setback (2) while they are grappled, and you no longer halve movement when dragging grappled creatures.
- Atomic Backbreaker: As a full-round action, you may initiate the Atomic Backbreaker on a character you are grappling. This is an attack that automatically hits, dealing 2Pd10+STR damage to the target. Performing the Backbreaker breaks the target free from the grapple, but leaves them Prone.

### Strategist/Sentinel

>[!quote] “Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.”

#### Path of the Aeon

>[!quote] "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

- The Jester: Once per round, damaging a Doomed target deals the condition's magnitude as damage to all other enemies within 10 feet. When you slay a Doomed enemy, your next Doomed condition you inflict in the same strife has its magnitude increased by P.
- The Magus: Once per round, when you land a damaging attack with an area of effect, you deal P true damage to each target. If any allies are also in the area of effect, you grant them P temp HP instead.
- The Priestess: Spend a lesser slot to brand an enemy within 60 feet as a major action (or as part of a non-damaging major action). Whenever you or an ally gains temp HP, or an enemy takes damage from you, the branded target takes P damage. This effect cannot trigger off itself or off the same ability more than once per (any) turn, lasts one minute or until the target takes 10P damage. If the effect expires from taking 10P damage, or the target dying, you heal for Pd3 hit points.
- The Art: Whenever you inflict an effect that imposes a hit malus from, hit bonus against, Doom, or Lethal on an enemy, you add +2 to the magnitude of its effect.
- The Universe: You reduce all forced movement taken by 10 feet and increase your block radius by 10 feet. Additionally, if an ally within your block radius and unobstructed line of sight in a strife moves by means other than a move action, they can choose to move into adjacency with you instead, regardless of distance; if a condition prevents them from doing this, you or the ally can spend a lesser slot as a free action to remove those conditions first.

#### Path of the Ancient

>[!quote] “Forward! Remember that from those monuments yonder forty centuries look down upon you!"

- Ironclad Resolution: You are always considered to be Warded (0). If you gain Ward by other means, you instead have a +2 bonus to its Fort/Will benefits.
- Bolstered Faith: Whenever you generate temporary hit points, its recipients also have +1 to hit, +1 to AC, and +1 die size to all Aim and Block dice while the temp HP persists.
- Inspired Improvisation: Whenever you inflict any condition on a target, Aim dice used against those targets can alternately be used on skill checks while the conditions persist. When you Aim, the Aim dice have +1 die size.
- Forward: Choose one:

- Into the Breach: Whenever you use damaging abilitechs and/or subpowers, you may add half the magnitude of all hit or AC/resistance maluses on the target combined to crit range, up to +3.
- Press the Advantage: Abilitechs and subpowers against targets you have Exposed or Impaired have +1 die size, +2 die sizes if both.

- Fearless Resolve: Any temporary hit points you gain now stack with itself from any other sources. Additionally, you add +P to all temp HP you gain or grant, and any temp HP that you grant to others or others grant to you stacks with other temp HP already present.

#### Path of the Aspirant

>[!quote] "Mankind's true place is to dwell in primordial chaos from where it originally sprung from."

- Astral Windvane: When you Scrutinize a target, your next lesser slot ability against them has the slot refunded if the ability misses. If you can claim the automatic hit for it, you can do so with any at-will or lesser slot psionic attack.
- Sixth Heavenly Current: Once per round per healed target, when you heal yourself or an ally, you may deal P damage to a target of choice within 50 feet of the healed target. This is an at-will subpower.
- Ex Tenebris: As a minor action, conjure a mote of light around yourself that illuminates a 30 ft. radius for 1 round. Targets of your choice within the light have -2 die sizes to Aim and Block dice. If you have at least a +8 to your psi skill, it also imposes -2 crit range and -50% bonus damage gained from Assail.
- Aetherlight: If you have not yet moved this turn, as a minor action you may lay down an intangible beacon at your location. Until the end of your next turn, if you can move to the beacon, you teleport the equivalent distance. If you expend a lesser slot with the minor action, the beacon lasts for 1 minute, and you may teleport to the beacon regardless of distance as a free action, once (or expend a lesser slot per subsequent use per beacon).
- Pale Quickening: Choose a minor action psionic subpower or Step ability; when you roll for initiative, you may perform it as part of the initiative roll. You must still meet any conditions to use it, spend any resources, and observe any use limits as normal. You may switch the chosen action between short or long rests.

#### Path of the Crucible

>[!quote] "By the word, I wind the gears."

- Alms for the Arsenal: Increase the cache multiplier of any known specibus by 2, if it has one. When you use a cache abilitech, you can spend 1 cache as part of the action to increase the duration of any inflicted conditions by 1 round or increase the radius of any area of effects by 10 feet.
- Feasts for the Forge: Increase the maximum rounds/charges of any known specibus by +50% (min 1), if it has any. When you restore any rounds/charges as an abilitech (or when it otherwise restores/recharges), you may spend 2P HP or a lesser slot to imbue them. Mark the restored rounds/charges; any abilitechs that consume them inflicts Cripple (10, 1 round), Lethal (P, stacks to 3P), or Daze (1 round). If it only restored a single round/charge, you may pick any two, or apply one twice.
- Haste for the Harrier: You may substitute a reaction in place of a minor action for any Reload abilitechs.
- Mimickry for the Master: As a major action, expend a greater slot and pick a control specibus. Your specibus comes alive for the next 1 minute as a psionic minion(s), moving and acting as you will it without an action cost from you. It lasts for 1 minute, acts during your turn, and uses your skill bonuses where relevant. On its turn, it may move and use one abilitech it possesses, even ones you did not know when wielding it.
- Tolls for the Tyrant: As a major action, expend a lesser slot and sap energy from all enemies within a 50 ft. radius. Each enemy gains Lethal (2P). Pick a specibus or power; for every enemy Lethaled, gain +1 to hit with it for 1 minute, up to +4.

#### Path of the Shepherd

>[!quote] "No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again."

- Thargelian Libation: As a reaction to being hit by a damaging attack, a minion adjacent to you or the attacker (or between) intercedes, transferring up to 2P damage taken to the minion. Any die size increases to abilitechs/subpowers also increases this.
- Light in the World of Tempest: In a strife, when you use a strife/rest-limited Step, you and allies within your block radius have +1 to attack rolls and skill checks (to a maximum of +3) for the remainder of the strife.
- Lycidian Memory: Minions within your block radius have Aegis (P). If you Avert as a minor action, you may forego one Block die from it to extend this to yourself and all other allies within range for 1 round.
- Role of the Hound: Once per round, when you land a single-target damaging attack, you may take -50% damage to issue an order. Your next subpower that commands minions to attack allows one minion to make a second attack as part of the action.
- Blessed be the Witness: Once per attack, when your minion lands a damaging attack, it may spend P hit points to gain +1 die size to damage. Alternately, do this with your minion when dealing damage through a control specibus. If you have a block radius, willing non-minion allies within it may voluntarily spend P HP for this as well.

#### Path of the Shadowdancer

>[!quote] “Fear not the darkness but welcome its embrace.”

Shadow Play: Path of the Shadowdancer has Steps with Shadewalk, a special type of movement where you functionally teleport, allowing feats such as moving across chasms and swapping cover without being seen.

- Shadowstep: Once per three rounds, you may Shadewalk 20 feet in any direction within line of sight as a reaction. Alternately, when you Dash, you can Shadewalk all movement for the rest of that turn. Independently of the cooldown, you may Shadewalk when moving through any reaction.
- Doppelganger: Once per three rounds, as a reaction (or as part of using a Shadowdancer Step), 3 mirror images of yourself appear alongside you in the same space. All attacks/abilities of choice against you must target a mirror image first. Attacks with multiple targets hits one image per target, and area of effect attacks hit you and all images simultaneously. Images last for 1 round or an ability is used against them.

- Human Shield: When you Help, Defend, or perform a non-damaging major action abilitech or subpower, as part of the action you may swap positions with an ally within your line of sight and range equal to your speed.
- Made You Blink: If you have not moved yet this turn, when you attack an enemy within range equal to your speed, you may choose to swap places with them. Once per minute, you may ignore the requirement that the target is within your speed's range (they still need to be within the attack's range to make it at all).
- Clothesline: Twice per round, when you move through an enemy by any means besides a move action (or adjacent to them at any point during that movement), you may roll an Athletics or Acrobatics check versus their Fortitude. If you break resistance, you knock them Prone. You may only target one enemy in this way per turn.

#### Path of the Skirmisher

>[!quote] "You're too slow!”

- Shock Assault: When you can perform a lunge attack (you do not need to use an abilitech/subpower with the Lunge property), your next attack inflicts Doom (P) on the target and grants you Aegis (P, 1 round).
- Signal Modulation: Twice per short rest, as a free action, you commandeer the aux cord and either increase or decrease the durations of each condition in the strife by 1 round.
- Hard Target: At the end of each of your turns, you gain +1 to AC/resistances for every 10 feet you moved by means besides your move action or beyond your base speed, up to +4, until the start of your next turn. When you move allies, you grant them +1 to AC/resistances for every 10 feet moved, up to +4, for 1 round.
- Escort Protocol: When a creature moves away from you while within block radius (or adjacent if no radius), you may move up to 10 feet as a reaction as long as your new position is also adjacent or as close as possible. You may Cripple (X, 1 round) yourself up to your base speed to increase the distanced moved by the same.
- Maneuver Tactics: In a strife, when you generate Block dice and the bonus dice are used, the result can be added to the beneficiary's next skill check against the attacker. If the Block dice persists for a duration instead of one use, use the most recent result.

#### Path of the Tower

>[!quote] “Against such abominations, we organize our defenses on the principle that one strong and able mind can shield the many."

- Line in the Sand: As a major action, you draw up to four lines, each 10 feet long and 30 feet high with one end within 45 feet of yourself. Any enemies that move through or start their turn in this area are Crippled (half) and Dazed for 1 round. The fields last for 1 minute. Usable once per minute.
- Stalwart Defense: Whenever you expend a lesser slot in a strife, you have +1 to AC/resistances until the end of the strife. This may stack up to +3 in this way. If you expend a greater slot, take the +3 immediately instead.
- Bad Apple: Whenever you make a psionic attack with an area of effect, lasting psionic tremors make the area difficult terrain for 1 round. If it already does this, the duration is increased by 1 round instead.
- Rarefication: Whenever you expend a lesser slot, take your Con mod, PCM, or Lvl/2, whichever is greatest. You heal for that many hit points. If you expend a greater slot, add any two of choice.
- Battlements of Academia: Whenever you use a non-damaging major action abilitech and/or subpower, you gain Aegis (P, 1 round).
