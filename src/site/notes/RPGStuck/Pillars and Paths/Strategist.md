>[!important] Rapidity (level 1):
>Once per round, when you Aim, Avert, Assail, or make a skill check in a strife as part of an action or ability, you have +1d3 to your crit range for 1 round. Additionally, once per round, you can Discern as a free action. If you already know at least one hidden feature about your target, you have advantage on this check.

>[!important] Countermeasure (2 Steps): 
>Once per strife, as a reaction to an attack made from or against a target within 30 feet of you, make a skill check, of your choice. If the skill check beats the attack, the attack does half damage and deals no additional effects, as long as you can justify why the skill you rolled might work in this way.

>[!important] Favored Tactic (4 Steps): 
>Pick an ability from Pillars and Paths or racial features that is limited in use per strife or short rest. This limit is raised by one.

>[!important] Expeditious (6 Steps): 
>Your base speed is increased by 10 feet.
